Android 15

### Installation type

_No response_

### Version

```shell

```

### Description

I attempted to run Sing Box [here](https://nativebridge.io/app/QtPe) to test its compatibility in a browser-based environment. However, it fails to load properly. The issue appears to be related to error logs, missing libraries, or dependencies. It either crashes on startup or hangs on [specific screen].

Are there any known dependencies (native libraries, permissions, network calls) that might be causing this?

### Reproduction

Downloaded the APK from the latest releases.

Uploaded it to Nativbridge.io for testing in a browser environment.

Attempted to launch the app, but it failed with UI issues

Checked logs or console output but found no clear error message.

### Integrity requirements

- [x] I confirm that I have read the documentation, understand the meaning of all the configuration items I wrote, and did not pile up seemingly useful options or default values.

Change log level from `panic` to `debug`, then rerun.

### Description of the problem

sing-box 服务器配置了一个 vmess 服务，底层传输协议为 gRPC。当客户端发起一个请求（具体来说，是在 v2rayN 里点击“测试服务器真连接延迟”时），sing-box 服务端将会 panic
虽然我知道可能会被认为是 v2rayN 客户端的问题，但是“测试服务器真连接延迟”功能只是对 google.com 发起了一个请求并立即关闭连接而已，理应考虑是 sing-box 存在问题

I can't tell if it happened also on previous versions as we had changed a few mods before the upgrade. I can't call recall such behaviour in 4 years though


### Steps to reproduce

1. compile a MT server (ours is the docker version, don't know if it's relevant)
2. inside of it, put a mod with hard dependencies such as [arena_lib](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Zughy/arena_lib/)
3. launch it
4. watch it fail, silently
5. put the required dependencies ([audio_lib](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Zughy/audio_lib/) and [signs_lib](https://content.minetest.net/packages/mt-mods/signs_lib/))
6. now it works"

Hi!

Sorry but on mobile ios, mindustry crashes on any fish ( community) server. Tried other alex and eviction servers and works, but on fish crashes for some reason.  NO MODS installed.

I tried reinstalling, updating ios, but just quits app whenever i try to join a fish server. Not a problem with other servers for some reason… was there a server update?

Im on phone12promax btw( i know… but the only way i can work and childcare is with my stup phone.)

If it doesnt work on ios now, might be the end of mindustry journey for me 😦

If its an end of a great journey for me on,its been a tremendous honor and i hope to see u in near future!

Otherwise, pls let me know if theres something that can be reasonably fixed!

- [x] This is a bug in RetroArch frontend
- [x] I have searched the existing issues

### Description

The Cloud Sync functionality on Windows will cause RetroArch to crash entirely upon trying to fetch a file from the server, other than manifest.server (which works fine). The crash does not occur on iOS or tvOS.

### Expected behavior

The server file should be fetched and overwrite the local file without crashing the application.

### Steps to reproduce the bug

1. Synchronize local files from Windows via Cloud Sync to a WebDAV server.
2. Change any file and update the manifest.server file with the new corresponding hash values (for example by updating the save on the iOS version and letting Cloud Sync run).
3. Start RetroArch on Windows again, causing Cloud Sync to run.

Touching the fingerprint sensor on my Xiami Pocophone F1 toggles netplay. This causes crashes in certain cores such as VBA next. There is no key/button bound to netplay toggle.


### Steps to reproduce the bug

Simply touching the fingerprint sensor makes the ""netplay will be started when a game is started"" message appear. If in game (I have only tested this on VBA next so far) it causes a crash.

### Game Version

4.14.11

### Describe the bug

It just crashes.
I am playing on a 300x150 map, and as soon as I clicked on Next Turn, and the Satelites would finish the next turn, the whole map would be revealed.

The truth is that it was working for a long time, and the fan on my computer went full speed... and then it crashed.

I'm guessing the map is too large, and the game goes out of memory.  So not much you can do.. but I thought I'd report it anyway.

### Describe the bug

This has been happening in previous versions. I think the earliest I noticed was 4.11 but wasn't sure because I would usually be looking away from the screen when this happens

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Set up all AI games with myself as spectator
2. Start the match

Running the wlfreerdp client on Wayland under river WM. Connecting to Windows 10 with **/gfx:avc444**. FreeRDP crashes with ""Segmentation fault"" (or ""Aborted"" with **-suppress-output**), while switching river's tags (i.e. workspaces).

For example, FreeRDP is on tag 2, when I switch to tag 1 and then go back to 2, only the terminal window with the wlfreerdp error remains. Sometimes it swiches successfully without the crash, but after some tries it eventually crashes.

If I don't ever switch tags, it works fine.
ClearCodec/Progressive mode (i.e. **+gfx-progressive**) works fine.

_As a sidenote: didn't test, but I believe this will reproduce on other wlroots-based WMs._

**To Reproduce**
1. Run wlfreerdp under river with fullscreen AVC **/gfx:avc444** on one tag, and make sure the H.264 codec is in use (e.g. Connection Profile 2048)
2. Try to switch tags a couple of times
3. Observe the segfault

I am unable to add sms rule, like as an example if i try to add .*test.*- it's not getting added into the list.
If i try to add like  .*(abc|xyz).* on a preexisting rule - the app is getting crashed.
I have added the asterisk after (.) which is not showing in github, but you get the point.

[ ] Documentation

## Description and/or steps/code to reproduce the problem

When using osmdroid/OsmBonusPack/mapsforge for over 10 years (icm Osmdroid) I notice that the following statement crashes starting from mapsforge 0.16.

`MapsForgeTileSource.createInstance(WaypointActivity.thisActivity.getApplication());`

The code is: 

```
MapsForgeTileSource.createInstance(WaypointActivity.thisActivity.getApplication());
fromFiles = MapsForgeTileSource.createFromFiles(maps, null, ""rendertheme-v4"");
```

The throwable is: 

> No static method createInstance(Landroid/app/Application;)V in class Lorg/mapsforge/map/android/graphics/AndroidGraphicFactory; or its super classes (declaration of 'org.mapsforge.map.android.graphics.AndroidGraphicFactory' appears in /data/app/~~laEjx5I8V-XmU4cjjSp55g==/nl.xyz.waypoints-bm2Vl1W1bERcWAFv13MvjQ==/base.apk!classes20.dex)

When upgrading to 0.16, the first statements fails. Why? Any change on that one?
When skippling the createInstance, I see an 'empty' map file. It won't crash any more.

My dependencies section contains:

```
    implementation 'com.github.MKergall:osmbonuspack:6.9.0'

I downloaded the source code, compiled it and installed the debug variant on my phone, and it seems it just works as expected; no crash anymore, thankfully to the latest commits made by you.

By the way, android studio seems not to find the gradle tasks like assembleDebug, actually none at all, expect testDebugUnitTest and testReleaseUnitTest. Even by using the gradle wrapper (`gradlew.bat tasks`), the assembleDebug task is not listed. I just came across the android documentation that stated to use the assembleDebug task, so I blindly ran it against gradlew (`gradlew.bat assembleDebug`) after installing the Java Developement Kit 23 manually.

A README.md for how to work with the source code would be phenomenal."

---

The app crashes everytime I hit the upload button. I've made 502 changes (which is now really frustrating). My changes are still cached, which I at least appreciate, but it doesn't help that I can't push them regardless.

I presume it's not due to the server upload process since that happens after I approve it and add the notes. My guess is it's when it tries to render 500 change items..?

Worse, I can't even export an OSC file. The button is disabled (wth?).

My only other option for uploading appears to be manually copying every change to the browser editor which actually does work.

Now, I get that 500 changes is probably too many. But if so, the app is still at fault for letting me even make that many changes before requiring upload.
If nothing else, PREVENT a user from making more than however many changes it takes to break the app, and require them to upload before proceeding.

Thx. I am also a developer. If this app is open sourced, I would consider contributing, even if just for my own sanity..

**Describe the bug**

I saw version 1.16.9 show up in Izzy's repo (which, much to my annoyance, always includes only the armeami-v7a build - I have a visceral hatred of installing 32-applications on a 64-bit operating system) a couple of days ago, but so far, the Session F-Droid repo does not include that release.

**To reproduce**

Install Session F-Droid repo and sync.

- [X] I have read and agree to adhere to the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/oxen-io/session-android/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Describe the Bug

I've experienced that whenever a voice message it's playing, if I decide to remove it (and do something else), the same keeps playing in the background.

> Not sure if this could be considered a bug, but I think the voice message should stop playing from the moment it's removed.

## To Reproduce

1. Tell someone to send you a (not so short) voice message — or just send one to yourself
2. Play the voice message to listen to it
3. Remove it right away
4. Enjoy the voice message in the background until it finishes :wink:

When reconnecting to the internet, or switching networks between data and wifi, Session doesn't reconnect to the network immediately. It will reconnect after several minutes, perhaps a half hour.

### Steps to reproduce
- Disconnect and reconnect to the internet

No messages come in. Network indicator icon Session shows disconnected.

**Expected result:**
When connecting to the internet in previous versions of Session, it would reconnect to the Loki network within about a minute. I have not upgraded nor made system changes to my device.

**Thoughts**
Perhaps this is a result of some change to make the client more battery efficient?

Where is the much-publicized privacy of this app? You user want to check? Take new device and put your recovery phrase and you will see all your old message's again!! That's terrible!

Take new session installation and put recovery phrase. Done. All your secure messages will appear again and you fuck**.

**Describe the bug**

I installed Session on two devices from F-Droid (Izzy Repository) and I can only send messages one way. On the phone on which I can send messages I cannot receive the username of my opponent, but I can receive messages on the device that fails to send messages back.

So, the affected device is unable to upload data, but it can download data. 

Sent messages show the `...` icon and the contact name of the affected device is just the SessionID on other devices (thus, the username is not uploaded as well)

**To reproduce**

Steps to reproduce the behavior:

- Adding the session ID of the working device on the affected device by scanning the QR code (which works, because it's only downloading)
- Receiving messages (which works on affected device)
- Replying with a message (which does not work, because it's uploading)

OR

- Adding the session ID of the affected device on the working device (does not work, because the affected device cannot upload to the loki network)

This issue can be reproduced on iOS, Android, and macOS. I have not tested Windows version yet. 

**To reproduce**

1. Send someone with some messages which have the disappearing timer set to like 30 seconds.
2. Wait until they disappeared on both sides.
3. Log out the account: Settings - Clear Data - Delete - Device Only.
4. Re-login to the account using the recovery phrase (actually I don't understand the difference between ""Continue You Session"" and ""Link a Device"" while re-logging-in. I tested both  and the issue remains the same).
5. You will find all the messages which are supposed to disappear come back. The timer for them are reset to what you set before.

**Additional context**

I suspect this issue is not platform-specific, but has something to do with the underlying message disappearing mechanism. Does the nodes keeps the messages forever without checking or deleting them?"

When I use desktop to send myself an attachment as a note-to-self, the attachment is inaccessible on Android. Tapping the message does nothing.

Similarly, even when Android is the sender, I cannot open the message attachment after sending it.

I have not tested whether the behaviour is confined to notes to self.

**To reproduce**

Send or receive a note-to-self message containing an attachment.

Tap on the message. Nothing happens.

I'm using CIrrus Version 2.9  (from f-droid) on a Lenovo tablet and on a Fairphone (both with Android 14) and on both I've noticed the WeatherWidget5day widget wasn't change day, so I've investigate deeply. Also the WeatherWidget doesn't update accordingly with the specified period. 

**How to Reproduce**
I have tried to set the shortest period available (15 min) and wait multiple time to see the time changing on WeatherWidget (who shows a reference time to the latest update) but nothing happens. 
Also I would expect to see an immediate update after a cold boot (when the period selected has clearly expired) instead it doesn't happen.

Also I've checked the background network traffic of this app and I see too few bytes exchanged, so I think the related service doesn't work correctly

**Expected behavior**

WeatherWidget5day must change days and show updated forecast
WeatherWidget must show updated forecast and the time of the last data fetched accordingly with the settings

#### Steps to reproduce
Issue is unable to reproduce on all mobile devices and appears to be random. Despite multiple app re-installs, the behavior is consistent on this device.

#### Expected behavior
After the recent app update for iOS, I am unable to switch servers using the 'Your servers' icon in the upper left. Futhermore, the channel name on the top of the screen is cut off. This ""shift"" up hides the the ""servers"" icon and part of the channel name behind the classification banner at the top of the screen.

#### Observed behavior (that appears unintentional)
The attached photo was intentionally cropped and classification banner edited. But as you can see, the ""Your servers"" icon is missing when it should be located just below the classification banner.

### Describe the Bug

If you create a bookmark and later update its URL, it is not updated in Linkwarden. It still refers to the old URL. Sometimes URLs gets updated like in GitHub when the repo changes from private to organization, or you remove unnecessary parts of it like trackers etc...


I know it is not possible to edit URLs in Linkwarden too, but maybe this is something to worked on.

### Expected Behavior

Update the URL or delete the old one and save the new one. Maybe moving the old one to an ""archive"" would be great.

### To Reproduce

Create a bookmark, wait for Linkwarden to finish. Update the URL :)

### Describe the Bug

Duplication of javascript bookmarklets after reopening the browser.

Every time the browser is reopened and a ""pull down"" operation is executed, a new bookmarklet will be added. If the ""pull down"" operation is executed more than once during the same browsing session, there is no duplication.

**Bookmarklet**
```javascript
javascript:(function(){var a=window,b=document,c=encodeURIComponent,e=c(document.title),d=a.open('https://nextcloud.myserver.com/apps/bookmarks/bookmarklet?url='+c(b.location)+'&title='+e,'bkmk_popup','left='+((a.screenX||a.screenLeft)+10)+',top='+((a.screenY||a.screenTop)+10)+',height=650px,width=550px,resizable=1,alwaysRaised=1');a.setTimeout(function(){d.focus()},300);})();
```


### Expected Behavior

The javascript bookmarklet shoud not be multiplied.

### To Reproduce

1. From Nextcloud bookmarks, create a bookmarklet (for adding new bookmarks)  and save it in the browser bookmark list.
2. **Push up** the bookmarklet so it appears in Nextcloud online bookmarks list
3. **Pull down** using Floccus extension in another browser (Firefox or Chrome). The bookmarklet should appear in the new browser.
4. Reopen the browser and **pull down** again. Now there are multiple bookmarklets. If you **pull down** within the same session, no extra bookmarklets will appear. The duplication only occurs when a new browser session is initiated.

**NOTE:** Sync is not enabled. ""Push up"" and ""pull down"" operations are executed manually.

### Describe the Bug

Synchronizing tabs after opening a pdf in Firefox ([click example](https://www.adobe.com/support/products/enterprise/knowledgecenter/media/c4611_sample_explain.pdf) and ""Open with Firefox"") causes an `Illegal URL` error.
When opening the PDF directly in the browser, the URL looks like `file:///tmp/mozilla_username0/filename.pdf` causing the error when synchronized to another browser.

### Expected Behavior

The `file://` URL should be used as-is. If pointing to a file that doesn't exist, the equivalent 404 page should be shown.
If the `file://` actually exists on disk on all synchronized browsers, it should simply restore the tab and open the existing file.

### To Reproduce

1. Visit https://www.adobe.com/support/products/enterprise/knowledgecenter/media/c4611_sample_explain.pdf
2. Click in ""Open with Firefox"" which should make the PDF open in Firefox using `pdf.js`.
3. The URL should contain file://`
4. Synchronize tabs using floccus.
5. In the second browser synchronize tabs. You should see the Debug error.

My bookmark structure contains multiple layers of folders. When I chose `HTML` as the synchronization format, everything was fine. Any browser with Floccus installed can synchronize normally and the directory hierarchy is correct.

But if I download the `HTML` file from `WebDAV` locally and import it into the browser as a file, the directory hierarchy of the bookmark will be lost. **_All bookmarks are in the root directory. No any folder._**

I'm not sure if this is a bug or a feature. Hope to your reply. Thank you.

### Describe the solution you'd like

- Down load the HTML file from WebDAV
- Import the file to browsers
- The bookmarks' structure is correct. With root folders and sub folders.

### Describe alternatives you've considered

Manually export bookmarks file from one browsers and import to another."

### Describe the Bug

I'm using Nextcloud webdav to store the bookmarks.xbel file and everything works fine except there is an annoyance in that floccus keeps creating a bookmarks.xbel.lock file and deleting it so my Nextcloud trash has many hundreds of these files in there. It created 130 of these files in the past 3 days alone.

### Expected Behavior

I wish it wasn't writing these .lock files every time it syncs, maybe there is a way to not write it to the filesystem and keep the application functional (or at least not write to the webdav filesystem).

### To Reproduce

Store the .xbel file in a webdav remote and let floccus sync then check your trash."

I simply can't sync with Brave, nor with Firefox. I deleted my account and created a new one. I connect to Google Drive without problems and set up a passphrase. Then the sync fails with error:

> E034: Bookmarks file is unreadable. Did you forget to set an encryption passphrase? Last synchronized: 0 seconds ago

even though there's no Bookmarks file in my Drive.

Here is the debug log:

Note: it was working fine before the last update...

Also, on Firefox, connecting to my Google Account fails (without any explanation).

### Describe the Bug

Scrolling up triggers the sync too easy. Mostly I hit the refresh even though I just wanted to scroll up.

### Expected Behavior

The UI should less sensitive to pull down when scrolling. The user should have a good control when to refresh and when not while scrolling the screen. Therefore it needs a certain area of tolerance where the user has to ""overscroll"" to make the refresh trigger.

### To Reproduce

Connect to server
Wait for first sync
Scroll till bottom
Try to scroll till top without triggering refresh

### Describe the Bug

I am using multiple accounts with the same account details (user@host) but a different bookmark file. The Android UI only lists the user@host part of the account on the LHS sidebar, so all accounts look identical even though they are not.

Furthermore, this is the only UI to switch between accounts, so there is no way to disambiguate except by trial-and-error, and memorising the order of accounts.

### Expected Behavior

The browser UI includes the bookmark filename when displaying the list of accounts. The Android UI should do the same.

### To Reproduce

As described above.

### Describe the Bug

For some months now I notice that the bookmark icon in Firefox's nav bar doesn't work anymore: When I click on the star, a menu like

![firefox-add-bookmark-dialog](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/729436/187098074-a0d39851-cf6f-46a4-9e21-56608429577f.png)

should appear. However, nothing is happening.

When I disable Floccus add-on, bookmark button in nav bar is working as expected.

When button is not working, it will also disable ""null"" as tooltip when I hover the icon while normally it should display ""Bookmark this page (CTRL+D)"".

Pressing CTRL+D will bring up the menu.

### Expected Behavior

The star icon in Firefox's nav bar should work, i.e.

- Should be colored when you visit an already bookmarked page
- Should display a menu when you to add or edit bookmark

### To Reproduce

1. Start Firefox
2. Visit any bookmarked page, check if star icon in nav bar is just shown as contours of a star or if you see a colored star (the latter will indicate that you are viewing a bookmarked page).
3. Also, try to click the star icon in nav bar and see if you get the bookmark add/edit dialog.

### Describe the Bug

When the app is started, it opens unwanted connections to `content-autofill.googleapis.com` on my phone. As you suspected in https://github.com/floccusaddon/floccus/discussions/962#discussioncomment-3222279 it really seems related to the Webview component that is used in the app.

A quick web search for that domain showed, that there are few similar reports for other apps. E.g. here https://www.kuketz-blog.de/lineageos-webview-bug-ungewollte-verbindungen-zu-content-autofill-googleapis-com/
However the phone, where this issue is observed, is a Samsung Galaxy S9+ with Android 10. Not rooted or modded in any way.

### Expected Behavior

Do not open unwanted and unneeded connections to Google services. Especially when option 'allow network usage"" (for favicons, etc.) is not set.

### To Reproduce

Just start the app.

Floccus synced a first few items, including most of the folders, then nothing else happened. Turning the extension on and off occasionally causes a few more items to be synced but then it gets stuck. I tried leaving it for 15 minutes but no further progress after the initial one. It is just indicating syncing indefinitely.

### Expected Behavior

Floccus syncs bookmarks as advertised.

1. Make a Floccus account
2. Wait for the sync/start the sync
3. Observe syncing without progress

I have a Nextcloud account set up for tab sync in the Chrome extension. One of the reasons I decided on this solution was explicitly for tab sync, so I could easily merge session management and bookmarks into a single flow; I like being able to drag tabs over to bookmarks easily and selectively, especially without having the device in question in front of me. However, it isn't working as I expected. Pulling changes from the server results in errors if they were not initially pushed by floccus.

### To Reproduce
Enable tab sync and create a new bookmark or folder in Nextcloud under the tab sync folder.

### Expected behavior
The newly created bookmarks are opened in the browser.

### Desktop
 - OS: Android, Windows
 - Browser: Chromium derivatives
 - Browser Version: Vivaldi 5.1.2526.3 (Chromium 96.0.4664.113), Ungoogled Chromium 96.0.4664.45, Kiwi 96.0.4664.46
 - Floccus version: 4.8.6
 - Floccus sync method: Nextcloud Bookmarks

### Server
 - OS: Alpine Linux Edge (Linux 5.15.11-1-lts x86_64)
 - Nextcloud version: Nextcloud Hub II 23.0.0
 - Bookmarks app version: 10.0.3

### Debug log
I get this error when floccus attempts to create tabs:

I get a E020 server error when adding a specific URL (https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems3/part-iv-image-effects/chapter-24-importance-being-linear) to my bookmarks. As soon as I remove this specific website from my bookmarks syncinc is possible again. I'm also able to add other new bookmarks, they sync just fine, so it seems to be a problem with the specific site. I get the following error on the Nextcloud server:

```
[index] Error: An exception occurred while executing a query: SQLSTATE[22001]: String data, right truncated: 1406 Data too long for column 'description' at row 1

POST /index.php/apps/bookmarks/public/rest/v2/bookmark
```

The strange thing is, that I'm able to add the URL directly via the web interface. Even syncing with the firefox plugin works after adding it manually on the server. The problem only occurs when I try to create the bookmark locally and sync it via the Firefox plugin. Do you have the same issue when trying to add a bookmark on this URL?

Edit: After adding the URL manually in the webinterface to some location I'm able to add it via my local clients to other folders as well. Do you just reference to existing entries in the database when adding the same entry twice on different locations?


### To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Ensure you do not have https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems3/part-iv-image-effects/chapter-24-importance-being-linear in your synced bookmarks
2. Go to https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems3/part-iv-image-effects/chapter-24-importance-being-linear
3. Add bookmark
4. Sync now via the floccus addon

The bookmark has been deleted on both sides. However, it hasn't, and when I go back to computer 1, the deleted bookmark is present again.

### Software versions

<!-- Please provide the versions of the following software products in your set up -->

- Browser: chrome
- Nextcloud: 15.0.5
- Nextcloud Bookmarks app:
- Floccus: 3.3.1
- Floccus sync method: XBEL
  <!-- Sync methods are either XBEL/webdav (signified as `webdav`), nextcloud Bookmarks legacy (signified as `nextcloud`), or nextcloud Bookmarks v0.14+ with folders (signified as `nextcloud-folders`) -->

### Steps to reproduce

<!-- What did you do? Be as specific as possible -->

1.  open Options for the account
2. select 60 min sync interval and click on trigger from scratch
3. save the changes pressing the Save button
4. Open Options again and all the save changes are not saved
### Expected outcome

<!-- What did you think was going to happen or what do you think should have happened? -->

The checkmark and the 60 min sync interval are not there

### Actual outcome

<!-- What actually happened after you did the above steps? -->

The sync interval is still empty and the checkmark is not selected

### Debug log
 unavailable

<!-- It is often useful to provide a debug log file along with the issue. You can obtain a debug log of the most recent sync runs by clicking 'Debug log' in the bottom right
corner of the floccus panel in your browser.

Note: As your debug log usually contains large parts of your bookmark data, instead of attaching it to the issue here, publicly, I recommend uploading it privately at the following URL https://klehranlage.net/index.php/s/7nn82NSBsfQKdsJ

3. When I use the extension ' [Bookmarks clean up](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bookmarks-clean-up/oncbjlgldmiagjophlhobkogeladjijl) ' to find duplicated bookmarks, the result is that all of my bookmarks are duplicate.

  <!-- Sync methods are either XBEL/webdav (signified as `webdav`), nextcloud Bookmarks legacy (signified as `nextcloud`), or nextcloud Bookmarks v0.14+ with folders (signified as `nextcloud-folders`) -->

### Steps to reproduce

I have a local folder called `A&B / C`.

1.  Pick above local folder in the options for a sync account: `/Bookmarks Toolbar/A&B \/ C`

### Expected outcome

If you click on the floccus icon in Firefox (`open floccus options`), you should see the folder `A&B / C`.

### Actual outcome

You only see `C`. Where the red block is, only the text `C` is shown.

This is not a huge issue, but I thought I should create a bug report nonetheless. I assume there is some sort of parsing going wrong and/or there is an issue with `&` or `/` in the name.

-->

### Software versions
<!-- Please provide the versions of the following software products in your set up -->

* Browser: Chrome, Firefox
* Nextcloud:
* Nextcloud Bookmarks app:
* Floccus:

### Steps to reproduce
<!-- What did you do? Be as specific as possible -->
1. There's something in Floccus that steals focus when Floccus updates in both Firefox and Chrome. For example, if I'm in Firefox and Floccus updates in the background, it then opens the Add-ons tab and changes focus to that tab while I'm doing other work. With Chrome, if it's minimized, Floccus, when updating itself, maximizes it and takes me to the Extensions page.

Given that literally no other Firefox Addon or Chrome Extension I have installed does this, it's some kind of bug/setting with Floccus. I have no idea how to debug this for you as it happens when Floccus background updates, but I'm hoping you know how to stop it because, as I'm sure you can imagine, it's frustrating behavior on the part of the extension.

Thanks.

* Browser: Chrome 65
* Nextcloud: 12.0.5

* Floccus: 2.0.6

### Steps to reproduce
1. Donate, whether it works entirely or not yet - this is damned fine software (in theory) and needs supporting.
2. On my home PC I copied all my bookmarks (about 2500 of them) into the bookmark folder that floccus uses for syncronisation.
3. Went onto my work PC (with a new install/profile of Chrome) and tried to sync them down.

### Expected outcome
It to sync up properly and down properly?

### Actual outcome
For some reason when it was syncing up it randomly stopped and said it had difficulty deleting entry with id 68 on the server.  I had to go into the SQL of the Nextcloud database into the bookmarks table and make a fake entry 68 just so it could then delete it.  Not sure why, I can provide extra information if I am able to (as I'll likely re-attempt uploading these all up again in the future when all the bugs I'm listing are ironed out)."

Horizontal scrolling has been a great addition recently, thanks for that!  As a result of this feature, I've been using capyreader more, and have run into some bugs.

1. Have load-full-article-text mode on
2. Have lots of feeds added
3. Scroll horizontally to go to the next article

Bugs I've seen:
1. The displayed article randomly switches to the previous article (perhaps due to the next article still being rendered).
2. After switching to a different application, and coming back to capyreader, the article that was open when switching apps is marked read and the next unread article is displayed on switching back instead.

### Expected behavior

1. No article skips (forward or backward) when navigating articles with horizontal scrolling
2. Same article displayed when switching back to capyreader from another application

I found a small quirk I cannot consistently repro

Basically sometimes the account settings are reverted.
Say I change the registration interval to 500. The next time I restart it goes back to what was before.

This happens with the Account nickname and display name as well.

One more thing, if Register is ticked and I restart, the settings stay.

I hope this debugging is useful,

I (Matthew) received a report from a user:

> EX told me to log out and log in again. Now I can’t decrypt my old messages anymore. Can anyone help me? (I think I never used recovery keys. At least everywhe else I log in, key exchange works, so I never had to enter a recovery key).

where ""key exchange"" is cross signing.

> Key backup and cross signing always have been active. That worked for several years for me on different devices.

> I did verify. Now I logged out, deleted the session, logged in again with verification – and all I see in 1:1 chats are the emojis attached to encrypted “waiting for this message” messages. 😕

### Outcome

#### What did you expect?

Verifying the device should have set up backup, but empirically it hasn't.  (Perhaps backup was never actually set up, and everything has been operating based on key sharing?)

#### What happened instead?

User has UTDs everywhere after logging in on EX, after logging out.

### Installation type

### If you are using a graphical client, please provide the version of the client.

### Version

```shell

```

### Description

According to the documentation, when `no_drop` is set to true, packets should not be dropped even during flooding conditions. However, the current behavior does not match this specification. DEBUG level logs still show ""router: dropped due to flooding"" messages despite `no_drop` being set to true.

### Reproduction

To make it easier to reproduce the issue on iOS, I use Telegram-iOS as a test client and:
   - Reject IPv4 requests
   - Reject port 80 connections

Telegram-iOS should fall back to IPv6 on port 443 quickly when packets are rejected. Nonetheless, it keeps attempting connection for an extended period instead of failing fast and falling back to IPv6/443.

### Description

Seems sing-box outputs a strange index (`1`, `3`, `5`, ...) for matched DNS rules:

https://github.com/SagerNet/sing-box/blob/93966bdd36fc466de7b66d5e36900e3df568e936/route/route_dns.go#L59-L68

This behavior is different from the displayed index when showing matched route rule:

https://github.com/SagerNet/sing-box/blob/93966bdd36fc466de7b66d5e36900e3df568e936/route/route.go#L375-L380

### Description

Since the route refactoring of v1.11, SOCKS5 UDP can't be route correctly. Previously only scenario in #1370 is affected, but this gets worse since version 1.11.

https://github.com/SagerNet/sing/blob/809d8eca139712f6c833cea813674a1cb1154ba5/protocol/socks/handshake.go#L270
A line of `destination = request.Destination` is missing. However, this violated related RFCs, and a correct fix should always fill the destination with `0.0.0.0:0` as described in #1370.



https://github.com/SagerNet/sing-box/blob/8a138e34ccac59295e90a3885e8225631aa26311/route/route.go#L464-L475

These lines are for handling `0.0.0.0:0`, but they should be moved to a location before `:match`.

https://github.com/SagerNet/sing-box/blob/8a138e34ccac59295e90a3885e8225631aa26311/route/route.go#L368

### Reproduction

Use software that support SOCKS5 UDP ASSOCIATE to test. e.g. configure NATTypeTester to use SOCKS5 proxy `127.0.0.1:1080` and do UDP STUN test.

### Description

I'm using sing-box for the first time and using the official recommended configuration. I found that as long as the private ip is released: `geoip=private => direct` sing-box will not work, but the proxy private ip log shows: `outbound/
trojan[trojan-out]: outbound connection to
127.0.0.1:853` and `outbound/
trojan[trojan-out]: outbound connection to
172.19.0.2:53`, it will work. What is the problem?

Why such a delay, it should be close to 0 ms

### Description

sing-box IOS客户端，xtls-rprx-vision协议，在使用默认的geosite.db时可正常启动，由于官方数据库无法屏蔽一些网站的广告，在尝试采用以下地址的规则 (https://github.com/soffchen/sing-geosite/releases/latest/download/geosite.db) 时，在iOS端会导致tun无法启动，且无相关错误日志生成，在加载geosite数据库后就自动关闭了tun服务，启动失败。不知是不是iOS端有数据库大小的限制，禁用内存限制不起作用。
同样规则在Android客户端以及Windows端，Windows基于Sing-box的第三方图形客户端都可以正常加载使用，所以可能不是第三方规则数据库错误的原因。
我了解1.8.0版本移除了geofile，不过基于现在发布的版本，还是希望得到一些指点。谢谢！

### Description

我有一个出站，类似这样，在 alpha.12 及以前并不会报错
```json
{
      ""tag"": ""一元的节点"",
      ""type"": ""trojan"",
      ""server"": ""123.123.123.123"",
      ""server_port"": 443,

      },
      ""transport"": {
        ""type"": ""ws"",
        ""headers"": {}
      }
    }
```
但是在 alpha.13，这个出站会报错：`FATAL[0000] decode config at sagernet.json: outbounds[5]: outbound options: json: error calling MarshalJSON for type *badjson.JSONObject: invalid character '}' looking for beginning of object key string`

这是预期行为吗？

### Reproduction

使用 alpha.13 版本执行 `./sing-box -D . -c config.json check`
以下是精简后的仍然可以触发报错的配置

### Reproduction

从1.51 更新到1.53出现此情况，然后只能卸载，安装 1.52 版就没问题。

当然 sing-box 安装在 fire tv 上比较小众，所以只是报告bug， 并不急切希望修正， 开发者估计有更重要的事情要做，能关注最好，不能我就用旧版。

### 描述

1. 如果对config.json进行修改后，重启sing-box, TUN模式，在windows下必须删除cache.db,否则就会无法上网，但是在Linux没有这样的情况。
2. 在windows 10下，使用powershell脚本启动sing-box:
`C:\User\xxx\AppData\sing-box\sing-box.exe run -c C:\User\xxx\AppData\sing-box\config.json`
必须执行两次，才能运行成功。

不知道是否我的问题，还是bug?

### 重现方式

第一个问题：windows下，修改config.json,不删除cache.db，重启sing-box

第二个问题：windows下，执行命令行启动

### Description of the problem

服务端是 Xray 未配置 TLS，通过 Nginx 反代部署 TLS。
当 `server` 为 IP 地址的时候，就会出现一个奇怪的问题，无论 sing-box 怎么配置 `server_name` 都是无法发送正确的 ServerName，导致 Nginx 发回了错误的证书。
简单研究一下，问题可能出在 [transport/v2raywebsocket/client.go](https://github.com/SagerNet/sing-box/blob/a8fcadab2554ad3c3ce390eddaa0bf96bbd8b13e/transport/v2raywebsocket/client.go) 或者 [gorilla/websocket](https://github.com/gorilla/websocket)。
当我尝试把 `uri.Host = serverAddr.String()` 修改为 `uri.Host = tlsConfig.Server()` 虽然也能链接，但是并不符合我预期的设置。尝试了删除 [`wsDialer.NetDialTLSContext`](https://github.com/SagerNet/sing-box/blob/a8fcadab2554ad3c3ce390eddaa0bf96bbd8b13e/transport/v2raywebsocket/client.go#L40) 并改用 `wsDialer.TLSClientConfig` 依旧返回了错误的证书。

### Description of the problem

用 1.2 内核都是这个问题，beta 1-5 都是，后台全杀，静置 10 分钟，链接数也是 300+
随着时间段推移，链接数 400+ ，后台全杀也降不下。颠峰的时候 800+
但是，我一旦换 1.1 的内核就没有这种情况
不管 1.1.1-1.1.5 都没有，而且这个 1.1 就算有 100+ 链接后台全杀立马降到 20+
找不到解

### Description of the problem

TLS traffic with IPv6 address as SNI is matched by rule `geosite`: `private`, even if the IPv6 address is a public address.

**_Caution:_** To reproduce the bug, I manually generated TLS requests to [2606:4700:4700::1111]:80 and 1.1.1.1:80. In normal usage, the requests are not expected to be made.

There is no problem with IPv4 as log shows.

Try to install the latest version and it doesn't work. I use minified but installing full doesn't work either. The app gets stuck in Android's ""installing"" screen and doesn't go further. The tablet restarts after a while with the old version installed instead of the new.

The bug is easy to replicate, only need to connect your mobile to Android Auto and the application is stucked in a loading page. If you try again with the previous version, the problem does not exist. If you execute the app and reproduce a playlist on you mobile and after that, you connect your mobile to Android Auto still reproducing but you cannot see anything in the car screen.

**Describe the bug**
Nextcloud seems to have a 30 second timeout for downloading files from federated shares. The Nextcloud developers [don't consider this a bug](https://help.nextcloud.com/t/curl-error-28-operation-timed-out-after-30000-milliseconds-with-0-bytes-received-federated-nextcloud/113088/4), saying it is required for responsiveness.

This is also an issue during Memories indexing. It fails to index the file with the error message: ""Failed to index file ...: Failed to get local file: cURL error 28: Operation timed out after 30000 milliseconds with ... out of ... bytes received"". This error is visible when doing a manual index using occ, but the issue still occurs with only the Nextcloud default cron job.

Due to the error, it appears that Memories does not consider the file as indexed and will happily try again. This results in large network traffic load every 15 minutes as it attempts, and fails, to download the file.

While ideally I would like Memories to download the file and generate a thumbnail for it, that is probably not going to happen. So instead, it would be nice if Memories marked this file as indexed without a thumbnail.

When looking at details of a photo with geotag, Aves seems to load on-line maps at the place. Maybe it doesn't send the precise location (not sure), but it must inherently send approximate photo location in order to load the appropriate map, unless all the data is in the cache.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Find a photo with geotag
2. Swipe for more information

**Expected behavior**
No network communication is performed, or sending the location is opt-in. From user PoV, I see several options:

a. Some off-line maps are supported. (This might be an overkill.)
b. Maps are loaded on-demand.
c. Automatic maps loading is opt-in.

Moreover, this should be covered in privacy policy.

When deleting the last file in a directory, the directory is deleted, too.

**To Reproduce**
1. Create a folder
2. Put two images into it
3. Open the first image in Aves and send it to trash
4. The directory still exists (checked in file manager)

**Expected behavior**
The directory is not deleted.
My Scenario is: My Camera app puts its photos in a folder on the internal storage, from there they are moved to the SD card from time to time, so this directory is sometimes empty. Now I take photo and delete it instantly -> the camera app's target directory is deleted and the camera fails to save photos.

When adding pictures to a new remote album from the Les Pas app, the file names are not preserved when they are uploaded to the Nextcloud server. This did not used to happen before; my old uploaded photos have their file names as they are on my phone (i.e. yyyymmdd_hhmmss.jpg). However, any new photos I add to a new remote album get renamed to some random number that increments up for that album (see screenshot). Perhaps a new update changed this behaviour, I am not sure. I would like the file names to be preserved like prior photos I have uploaded.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Click the '+' icon to create select photos
2. Create a new remote album for those photos
3. Observe the uploading where all the file names are renamed to the random numbers.

**Expected behavior**
The file names to be preserved upon uploading.

If you control left mouse click an adjacent open door with no known creatures in it, you get the message ""Unknown command"". Looking at the code, it looks like it is meant to close the door.

After picking up the boomerangs in the combat tutorial, the player is instructed to head over to the training dummy and type ""f"" to target the dummy automatically, which does not work. It is possible to use (capital) ""F"" to select the missile weapon in question manually or, better, ""Q"" to quiver the boomerangs, then use ""f"" as originally suggested. I knew this because of substantial prior experience with roguelikes, but an entirely new player might be very confused.

```
Let's say to start playing ri-li in easy mode, you complete level 1-9 and loose at level 10.
If you choose to play ""old level', you start again at level 10.

Now, assume that, later, you completed all levels in easy mode and started playing in
""normal"" mode. If you choose to play ""old level"" and then ""normal"", it will always choose
level 40 by default, even if you didn't complete all levels in this mode.
This is very boring since you have to change 40 to the actual level that you want, you have
to take care of remembering which level you previously lose at, and (in case you're wrong)
changing the level during a game is not easy.

It would be great if ri-li could remember the last completed level in all modes
(easy/normal/hard). But I guess it will require to change the menus since the user
would have to choose the mode first and then choose between ""new game"" and ""old level"".

### What area of the game / PPSSPP

While poking around the SDL build in my Manjaro, I noticed that when I run PPSSPP from the command line and pass a path to a dir containing an unpacked ISO, the emulator doesn't properly display the toast that's supposed to warn the users about the potential issues that may arise from playing the unpacked games.

It doesn't happen if I use the ""Recent"" entry for the same games.
Please note that I don't remember how to invoke any other toasts, so there may be more stuff broken.

### What should happen

I couldn't figure out what's wrong. Debugging revealed that the toast entry is saved to the dedicated array and later extracted for processing (and rendering?). Please investigate.

I have made a few attempts to fix issues with deathmatch in the past year or two. But it seems that every time I fix one issue, another is created. Recently it was changed to prevent accidentally initializing multiple simultaneous instances. But the new issue now is that if a player has closed the client while deathmatch is active, the quest is stuck in ""start"" state & a new instance cannot be started.


## 🔥 How to reproduce

Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to arena & start a deathmatch with Thanatos
2. exit client to exit from deathmatch
3. Restart & return to arena & try to start a deathmatch
4. Thanatos will give the reply that player must handle the current task at hand (which was meant to only occur if player was currently doing a deathmatch)

Some food/drink items are missing the ""use"" context menu option labelled as ""eat"" or ""drink"". The screenshot example shows the context menu for soup:

![Screenshot_20240410_134914_Stendhal](https://github.com/arianne/stendhal/assets/3631473/c9709f64-4eed-4648-ae1f-1097eef56b90)

It doesn't affect all food/drink items.

**Edit:** It appears to affect certain items that are created at login in player inventory. What I have found to be affected:
- experimental sandwich (Meal for Groongo Rahnnt quest) (not sure why this would be affected while standard sandwich is not as it is the same item with custom attributes)
- fish soup
- soup
- vsop koboldish torcibud


## 🔥 How to reproduce

Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Carry a newly created instance of one of the items listed above in inventory/bag.
2. Open item context menu to see that eat/drink option is available.
3. Restart web client.
4. Open item context menu to see that eat/drink option is NOT available.

**Edit:** It turns out the Java client does something similar. But instead of the option simply not being available after restart it is changed to ""use"". Because both clients are affected I am curious if it is actually a server-side issue.

Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. After having started Cloaks Collector quest, speak to Josephine.
2. Open chat options dialog & select ""cloak"".
3. Josephine does not respond because ""cloak"" is reserved for turning in cloak item.


## 🛠️ Suggested fixes

Since it isn't possible to change the trigger to the singular form ""cloak"" (because it is used as a trigger elsewhere), it may be good to change the dialogue & trigger for listing the remaining cloaks to something else. Perhaps one of the following:

- remaining
- left
- collection
- list

### Summary

After a lot of debugging there seems to be a very awkward issue and desync issue, mostly when rendering new chucks in Mineclonia/ MineClone 2. Whenever I attempt to generate new chunks, at random times it starts to have terrible desync issue(checked with lagometer), with that being said duly note that when I attempt generating super flat world or other smaller games in minetest this didn't occur.

Something important to note is that when I installed bare metal Linux on my MacBook, this issue was not occurring.
If I can help with any way and can provide any more information please contact me, I would be glad to help.

### Steps to reproduce

- start a world in mineclonia/mineclone 2
- start moving around and generating new chucks
- using lagometer you can spot dramatic ""lag"" occurring at times often, visually you see mobs constantly being teleported back to sync. "

5.7

##### Summary
```
minetest.dig_node(pos)

    Dig node with the same effects that a player would cause
    Returns true if successful, false on failure (e.g. protected location)
```

If I have a protected area, and I want to dig it, I have no way to specify the player. In mineclone2, our pistons cannot dig a block in a protected area because it considers them protected, even if the triggerer is the owner of the protection. It returns false regardless of who calls it. I have no way to tell the engine of the player so it can actually understand if it owns the area. 

""Dig node with the same effects that a player would cause"" would mean that a player who owns an area should be able to affect it. I would like the facility to pass in a player_name or a digger reference. I fear a digger reference won't cover this with things like daylight sensors, or delayed time based stuff, for example. So passing a name gives the modder control in multiple contexts.

As a modder/game developer, I would like to control who I consider to be calling this, so I can pass this in so a protection check can be correctly done. With remove_node, I can check the protection myself and call, and it will do it, but dig_node prevents me from having any control of this, and I would likely have to implement this logic from scratch to get it to work (get item, get drops, remove node, and add drops in).

I guess two ways to proceed with this are to either remove the protection check and leave that to the modder to do (as it doesn't work), or enable the modder to give enough context for the code to be able to do this correctly.

This requirement has also been mentioned here: https://github.com/minetest/minetest/issues/11336#issuecomment-860286772 but for a different issue, so it's worth considering that issue alongside this one, but they are different issues. That is a feature request, this is a bug where protection checks aren't fit for purpose.

##### Steps to reproduce

##### Summary

Sometimes while jumping around, you get pushed up a little bit in a jerky manner.  Depending on your jump physics, this can result in clearing two full nodes even when that would not normally be possible.

##### Steps to reproduce
Join most any Minetest world (I have reproduced the issue in Minetest game, Dev Test, and my own game)
Stand next to any solid node and hold w
Jump while still holding w

You will notice that your player does a little hop at the top of the node, kind of like when you step onto snow from normal ground.  In fact, that's my theory.  The engine thinks you need a step-up, and gives you one.  By the way, this allows you to jump up 2 nodes in all the games I mentioned.

If that really is the cause of the bug, maybe the fix is as simple as checking if the player is mid-air before stepping up."

When the player's 3rd person view offset is changed with 
``` player:set_eye_offset(vector.new(0,0,0), vector.new(0,10,-5))```

the -5 z offset does indeed back the view away from the player in rear view 3rd person

I would expect it to back it away from the player in front view 3rd person also, but instead it brings the camera closer to the player model, so that all you can see is the head.

The z offset should be inverted when in front view.

This is a bug when working with larger player models

Linux

### Build

bleeding-edge build 24953

### Issue

I have noticed as of late that when you use the payload system to transport items in bulk that the containers do not fill up. The Payload Loader fills up with 100 items, but containers or vaults (of Erekir or Serpulo) go right through and just pick up 8 to 10 items. Kinda acting like an unloader next to a plast conveyor.

### Steps to reproduce

- Place a Payload Loader.
- Place a Playload Unloader at a good distance.
- Surround each with a pair of Large Payload Mass Driver (conveyors optional).
- Place a Drill to mine something (fastest possible).
- Connect a duct or conveyor between the Drill and the Loader.
- Place a (Large) Contructor next to a Payload Conveyor or Mass Driver.
- Have it produce Containers or Vaults and feed it the needed resources.
- Watch these complete a circuit and just pass through the Loader as if it was a regular Conveyor.

The music that was playing was actually the [custom menu music from AvantTeam/ProjectUnityPublic](https://github.com/AvantTeam/ProjectUnityPublic/blob/master/main/assets/music/menu.ogg).

**Build**: `steam build 141.3`

**Issue**: First of all, thank you very much for having a data exporter in the first place (backups backups backups)... But I found a (minor?) problem with it. When naming the file I'm exporting, you have a parser that seemingly looks for file extensions, with the intent of using them for something, but instead it drops them. If I try to name my data file ""Mindustry6.0-7.0data"", taking the file extension to be implicitly "".zip"" rather than specifying it, the file name ends up being ""Mindustry6.0-7.zip"" (including the extension). The "".0data"" completely disappeared. I didn't mean for it to be treated as the file extension, but I would've preferred that to losing the text completely (or, I suppose, having to type a buffer extension or something).

**Steps to reproduce**: 

1. Load up the stated version of the game.
2. When the main menu appears, choose ""Settings > Game Data > Export Data""
3. choose a suitable location for your test export
4. for the file name field, use a name that contains a ""."", such as the one given in my example.
5. After saving, look at the file name in your file manager (e.g. File Explorer for Windows).

**Link(s) to mod(s) used**: `none`

**Save file**: `none`, as the issue happens in the main menu

**Build**: *steam build 141.2*

**Issue**: *I use Surge router to load balance an item filter and it stuck very often*
![Surge Router lock](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2516773/213806966-20583586-5a7d-48ec-b165-14cc1a19aefc.png)

**Steps to reproduce**:
1. add a Surge Conveyor line with at least 2 items types input in it (i had 4 in my case)
2. add a Surge Router with 2 Surge Conveyor output an nothing in the 3 output.

If an odd number of stack of one kind of item going through the Surge Router, then a stack of another item come, it stuck.
There are 2 half stacks on each output waiting to be completed, but the input items are not the same, so it never completes.

Behavior fix suggested : Instead of dividing stack in individual item to send them in each output, it should act like Reinforced Payload Router show well : alternate the destination of the stack and not of individual item. If there is hybrid output (some Surge and some not), it should act like if there was on surge Conveyor before the no-Surge output, so the stack go on the router output and only then is divided, but other output aren't lock.

Actual Workaround : Not using Surge Router, instead use Reinforced Container or Vault, as router with as many filtering Duct Unloaders as needed, outputting on Surge Conveyor. This way i can filter, load balance, and having big bandwidth (Duct Unloader number ×15)

**Build**: 140.4

**Issue**: tech tree and 3D planet map are inconsistent - Peaks, Ravine, Caldera were unlocked by playing online but they remain inaccessible and I cannot land there.

**Steps to reproduce**: I played campaign locally (reached Basin). Then I played with friends, ahead of what I have reached and completed Marsh, Peaks, Ravine. This unlocked Caldera and some tech in the tech tree.

But I cannot land on Caldera! I completed Basin what unlocked Marsh but I do not really want to play it again.

I would expect them to be selectable in 3D rendering of sector selector. Though making impossible to unlock content by playing online and making mandatory to redo it locally and have tech tree reflecting this could also work, I guess, to remove bug even if that would be irritating - at least to me.

BTW, eheater and nitrogen remain locked and are not even appearing in my tech tree.

Some people on Discord suggested

> try running Vars.content.sectors().each(b=>b.unlock()) in console

as workaround. I guess that similar may be needed for tech. And also proposed

> I mean just ask your friend for the campaign saves
> And import it into your planet

but not sure is it going to unlock things

1. Go into editor, menu, Generate
2. Use the following config:
```
[{class:terrain,seed:100008952,scl:69.86,threshold:0.93,octaves:3.015,falloff:0.52,magnitude:1.09,circleScl:1.35,floor:grass,block:shrubs},{class:noise,seed:248182888,scl:276.94498,threshold:0.51,octaves:3.1950002,floor:sand-floor,block:sand-wall},{class:scatter,seed:32336921,chance:0.035,flooronto:sand-floor,floor:sand-floor,block:sand-boulder}]

### Description

I ran into this when investigating https://github.com/libretro/RetroArch/issues/17718 .

If there is no input, I get locked out of the entire computer.
I can't even use Alt+F2 or whatever to change virtual terminals.
I have to hard reset to recover.

### Expected behavior

Retroarch exits immediately with an error message saying that no input was found, and why.

### Steps to reproduce the bug

1. Make sure your user does *not* have permission to access udev devices.
2. Change the input driver to udev.
3. For your own sake, run `sleep 30 && killall retroarch &`, so that you don't have to do a hard reboot.
4. Start retroarch from the vconsole.

### Description

So I just updated to the latest Android Nightly and now the touchscreen doesn't work properly ingame. It keeps going all over the place. I'm using it with @sonninnos PUAE core and the mouse pointer just goes crazy.
Also, maybe related, when I first updated it kept showing a different screen overlay from the one I previously use. I couldn't get rid off it until I edited the Retroarch cfg file.


### Expected behavior

Move mouse pointer with touchscreen

### Steps to reproduce the bug

1. Load a core with mouse input using touchscreen. I use @sonninnos PUAE core.
2. Try and move the mouse using the touchscreen.

- [x] This is a bug in RetroArch frontend
- [x] I have searched the existing issues

### Description

There are small artifacts on the edges of visuals. This is both in the ui and in games and only when using vulkan. This issue is only present on this tv and not on my 1440p monitor. Tested dolphin with vulkan to see if it was a universal vulkan issue and dolphin did not exhibit any artifacts while running games. Weirdly turning hdr on in windows but not turning it on in retroarch removes the artifacts. sdr always has artifacts. This is a workaround for now but I would like to use hdr on in vulkan without these artifacts

### Expected behavior

_No response_

### Steps to reproduce the bug

1. Switch driver to Vulkan.
2. Launch retroarch either in sdr mode or in hdr mode with hdr enabled in retroarch.

Hi,

It looks like 1.20.0 assumes that `pthread_t` is an integer which is defined as an opaque type per POSIX specifications. Thus it fails to build on musl:

### Description

When I start the game it freezes, but it is able to connect to retroachievements. It is entirely unresponsive, and only able to close the application by killing the process. The problem resides inside the while loop introduced by the commit found with bisect. Essentially if no audio is provided, the application will freeze.

### Expected behavior

No freeze.

### Steps to reproduce the bug

1. Block audio somehow?
2. Open retroarch and select game
3. Start game

I was trying to test some overlay behavior in wayland and can't click on any virtual buttons/analogs. I tried clearing my config and using older versions of RetroArch in case there was a regression but it appears to be longstanding/always this way. I also tried using different input and gamepad (just to be thorough) drivers (udev, sdl2, x) with no change. However, switching to Xorg fixes it instantly.

### Expected behavior

click on buttons with the mouse to trigger the button functions

### Actual behavior

the overlay is completely unresponsive

### Steps to reproduce the bug

1. use wayland
2. enable an overlay

Apparently i just discovered a bug where on both gpSP and mGBA (i haven't tried the rest of the cores yet), but these 2 allows the left+right combo on GBA which is impossible to replicate in real hardware (as well as VBA-M) as it'll overwrite the input with the newer one, i found out about this during my MS Advance playthrough where the game crashes way too often and i had to dug it up on google, this also forces me to intentionally play bad to avoid crash instead of taking full advantage of my skills. Is there should be an option to toggle between the combo or not."

No that is not a typo, the folder is literally called `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME` inside the home folder (~) and then `.config}`

eg: `/home/gman/${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/retroarch/config/Gambatte/Gambatte.opt`

Trying to build RetroArch with `--enable-videocore` fails when `switchres` is also selected. Switchres is now enabled automatically I think (on Linux ?), so just enabling the VC option leads to a build failure.

Either the build to not fail or `configure` to fail first, warning the user that the two options are not compatible.

I've noticed that when the ""Quit on Close Content"" option is used together with ""Auto Save State"", RetroArch writes the save state _twice_ when ""Close Content"" is selected, rather than once when ""Quit RetroArch"" is used.

Additionally, the second write appears to happen too late (and/or race with other parts of the exit flow), which leads to buggy interactions with various other options.

* When the ""Save State Thumbnails"" option is also enabled, the thumbnail seems to be written twice as well, but the second thumbnail ends up corrupt or empty. (Maybe the game's framebuffer is already gone by that point?)
* When a core override exists (even if it's just an empty `core.cfg` file), the core override is unloaded _before_ the second auto save is written, causing the second auto save to go to the wrong directory (e.g., ignoring options like ""Sort Save States into Folders by Core Name"" and ""Sort Save States into Folders by Content Directory"").

These issues appear to be side effects of the auto save being performed twice rather than issues with those additional options themselves.

### Expected behavior

When ""Quit on Close Content"" is enabled, ""Quit RetroArch"" and ""Close Content"" should behave identically. This includes writing the auto save state (and thumbnail, if enabled) exactly once.

### Actual behavior

""Quit RetroArch"" writes the auto save state once, as described above; however, ""Close Content"" writes it twice, leading to the issues described above.

### Steps to reproduce the bug

1. Create a new RetroArch install with default settings.
2. Configure RetroArch settings ""Quit on Close Content: ON"" and ""Auto Save State: ON"".
3. Optionally set ""Save State Thumbnails: ON"" to see the buggy interaction with thumbnail saving.
4. Optionally create a core override file (`core.cfg`) for the core you want to test to see how this causes an incorrect path to be used by the duplicate auto save. (The file can be empty.)
5. Load a game.
6. Quit RetroArch by selecting ""Close Content"" in the quick menu.

The issues described here seems to be independent of which core is used. At least I was able to repro the same issue with Gambette, mGBA, Mesen, and Snes9x.

I've attached three log files:

1. [`quit.log`](https://github.com/libretro/RetroArch/files/12885193/quit.log): Correct behavior when exiting with ""Quit"". Auto save state is written only once, in the correct location. Thumbnail is also written correctly.
2. [`close_content.log`](https://github.com/libretro/RetroArch/files/12885202/close_content.log): Incorrect behavior when exiting with ""Close Content"". Auto save state is written twice. Both writes go to the correct location, but thumbnail is empty due to second write.
3. [`close_content_with_core_override.log`](https://github.com/libretro/RetroArch/files/12885196/close_content_with_core_override.log): Incorrect behavior when exiting with ""Close Content"" when a core override is in use. Auto save state is written twice. Second write goes to incorrect location (`:/saves` rather than `:/saves/core`), and thumbnail is still empty.

Here is the relevant portions of the log file for the correct behavior (`quit.log`):

```
[INFO] [State]: Saving state ""C:\Users\bcat\Documents\Temp\RetroArch-Win64\states\Gambatte\144p Test Suite (0.23).state.auto"", 51464 bytes.
[INFO] Auto save state to ""C:\Users\bcat\Documents\Temp\RetroArch-Win64\states\Gambatte\144p Test Suite (0.23).state.auto"" succeeded.
[INFO] [Core]: Content ran for a total of: 00 hours, 00 minutes, 04 seconds.
[INFO] [Runtime]: Saving runtime log file: ""C:\Users\bcat\Documents\Temp\RetroArch-Win64\playlists\logs\Gambatte\144p Test Suite (0.23).lrtl"".
[INFO] [Core]: Unloading game..

[INFO] [Core]: Unloading core..
[INFO] [Core]: Unloading core symbols..
[INFO] [Core]: Saved core options file to ""C:\Users\bcat\Documents\Temp\RetroArch-Win64\config\Gambatte\Gambatte.opt"".
```

Now compare that to the worst case behavior (`close_content_with_core_override.log`):

```
[INFO] [Core]: Content ran for a total of: 00 hours, 00 minutes, 04 seconds.
[INFO] [Runtime]: Saving runtime log file: ""C:\Users\bcat\Documents\Temp\RetroArch-Win64\playlists\logs\Gambatte\144p Test Suite (0.23).lrtl"".
[INFO] [State]: Saving state ""C:\Users\bcat\Documents\Temp\RetroArch-Win64\states\Gambatte\144p Test Suite (0.23).state.auto"", 51464 bytes.
[INFO] Auto save state to ""C:\Users\bcat\Documents\Temp\RetroArch-Win64\states\Gambatte\144p Test Suite (0.23).state.auto"" succeeded.
[INFO] [Config]: Loading config: ""C:\Users\bcat\Documents\Temp\RetroArch-Win64\retroarch.cfg"".
[INFO] [Overrides]: Configuration overrides unloaded, original configuration restored.
[INFO] [Config]: Saved new config to ""C:\Users\bcat\Documents\Temp\RetroArch-Win64\retroarch.cfg"".
[INFO] [State]: Saving state ""C:\Users\bcat\Documents\Temp\RetroArch-Win64\states\144p Test Suite (0.23).state.auto"", 51464 bytes.
[INFO] Auto save state to ""C:\Users\bcat\Documents\Temp\RetroArch-Win64\states\144p Test Suite (0.23).state.auto"" succeeded.
[INFO] [Core]: No content, starting dummy core.
[INFO] [Core]: Content ran for a total of: 00 hours, 00 minutes, 00 seconds.
[INFO] [Core]: Unloading game..
[DEBUG] [Audio]: Stopped audio driver ""xaudio""
[INFO] [Core]: Unloading core..
[INFO] [Core]: Unloading core symbols..
[INFO] [Core]: Saved core options file to ""C:\Users\bcat\Documents\Temp\RetroArch-Win64\config\Gambatte\Gambatte.opt"".
```

In both cases, an auto save is first written to `:/states/Gambatte/144p Test Suite (0.23).state.auto` as expected. But when exiting using ""Close Content"", a second auto save is written to `:/states/Gambatte/144p Test Suite (0.23).state.auto`. The wrong path appears to be a result of the incorrect second save happening after the core override is unloaded.

## Description

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7110113/233108987-05abddd3-6842-4d8b-94bf-87b41a56d963.png)

Retropad port selection consumes too much memory when opening the list option selection (around 200 MB)
On low memory devices (like the Miyoo Mini+ / 128MB device) it freeze retroarch.

### Expected behavior

Be able to browse the list of ports without explosing the memory.
May be a virtual keyboard could be better to set it because going to port 25 000 could be long ?

### Actual behavior

The 99 999 values are loaded in memory before displaying only 17 values on screen (on RGUI)

### Steps to reproduce the bug

Go to settings -> network -> enable ""Network Retropad""  then set a value in ""Network Retropad Base Port""

RetroArch scanner generates a wrong path to an archived file if the file in the archive contains an accented character. For example, the letter é will be replaced with ?, and the rom will not be loaded if launched from the playlist. 

### Steps to reproduce the bug

1. Use manual scanner to scan directory containing zip file with a rom that has an accented character in its filename. 
2. Failure when attempting to load rom due to incorrect path in playlist. 

In my case, I'm trying to load ""Dragon Quest III (Japan) [T-En by DQ Translations v1.1] [Add by Rod Mérida v1.0c] [n].zip"" , which contains a rom with the same filename. The playlist scanner writes the rom's path as ""Dragon Quest III (Japan) [T-En by DQ Translations v1.1] [Add by Rod Mérida v1.0c] [n].zip#Dragon Quest III (Japan) [T-En by DQ Translations v1.1] [Add by Rod M?rida v1.0c] [n].sfc"" into the playlist file.

When using the ""Remember Size and Position"" option, if you create/load an override with different width/height values, the size and position will not be restored properly on close content, and the values of the override will also be applied to retroarch.cfg.

I wasn't able to reproduce on my Linux VM, so probably a Windows only bug.

### Expected behavior

Restore the window size when closing content when ""Remember Size and Position"" is enabled.

### Actual behavior

On close content the window stays at the override values. If the override was made while in fullscreen then your window will almost fill the entire screen on close content.

### Steps to reproduce the bug

1. Start RA in windowed mode.
2. Turn ON `Settings > Video > Windowed > Remember Size and Position` and set a fixed value of 1280x720 for example.
3. Restart RetroArch and start a game, press F to switch to fullscreen (or just change width/height values) and create a game/core override.
4. Close content and see that it doesn't restore the window properly and your values are now all wrong.

### Bisect Results

I was able to build the few first commits when the ""Remember"" option was added, looks like it never worked properly on Windows with overrides.

After setting the menu toggle gamepad combo to ""Start+Select"", subsequent usage of this menu toggle combo will open the menu, but the menu will be frozen--all you can do with it is press start+select again to close it. This exacerbates #6803, because after changing the menu toggle button combination you are unable to exit RetroArch normally and are unable to change the button combination back to what it was before.

### Actual behavior

The menu appears dimmed, and no button input is accepted save for start+select.

### Steps to reproduce the bug

1. Open any rom (only tested with SNES roms, though).
2. Press L+R+start+select.
3. Go into the input settings and change the menu toggle gamepad combo to ""Start+Select"".
4. Press start+select to exit the menu.

If I want to change hotkeys for a specific core (to disable fast forward for example, if I have it on the R trigger), or, if I would like to turn off the 'turbo' hold button that is built into the main input for each player, I cannot do this from the GUI and have it save properly. However, I can MANUALLY enter in the appropriate code into a core override file, and it will work - but if I then try to save more core overrides at a future date, all of the manual entries I entered in pertaining to inputs are automatically erased.


### Expected behavior

Any changes to hotkeys or inputs are saved as overrides via the GUI, and input related overrides are not erased every time a new override is added.



### Steps to reproduce the bug

1. Try to make changes to hotkeys or input settings for Player 1, and save a core override - settings will not save
2. Manually enter in the appropriate code into a core override file, e.g. the line ""input_player1_turbo_axis = ""+5"""" for NEStopia.cfg
3.  Save an override, and all of the data you manually entered in step 2 is gone.

With keyboard defaults, toggling mute with 'F9' causes slow-motion (hold 'e') to stop functioning while the audio is mute.  I observed the same behavior using both the FCEUmm core and Snes9x core, so it seems like a bug.  Work-around is decreasing volume.

### Expected behavior

Holding 'e' should activate slow-motion regardless of the mute state.

### Actual behavior

When mute is toggled on, slow motion stops working.

### Steps to reproduce the bug

1. Load rom
2. Hold 'e' and observe slow-motion working
3. Toggle mute 'on' with F9
4. Hold 'e' and notice slow-motion no longer works
5. Toggle mute 'off' with F9 and test slow-motion again

### Game Version

### Describe the bug

https://github.com/carriontrooper/Alpha-Frontier/issues/89

Forwarding a bug: I have a policy that makes it so that each city in your civ gets +3 happiness when your civwide happiness is lower than 3. Problem is, the added happiness disappeared when loading the game, and reappears after going into the city management screen.

I'll ask the bug submitter to provide a save.

I may also make a test mod for vanilla/GnK, adding a similar policy and an event that both allows you a free policy and negative happiness.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Play AF
2. Get the 'Censorship' policy
3. Have negative happiness
4. See error

### Describe the bug

If you have downloaded the music files, it will auto-play when the game regains focus, even if the music was paused before in the menu. This seems counterintuitive to me. On Linux this happens when I, minimize and re-open the game, unlock my screen, switch workspaces in Gnome etc. On Android this happens when switching between apps.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Download the game music files
2. Pause the music
3. Minimize the app (go to homescreen)
4. Re-open the app
5. The music starts playing again

4.14.9

### Describe the bug

In ""Rankings"" tab of the ""Victory status"" screen ""Culture"" column always displays 10 for every known civilization.

All the other columns display their correct (as far as I can tell) values, but Culture always shows 10 for every civilization, so they are just sorted in that column alphabetically.

### Steps to Reproduce

Prerequisites: have a game started and advanced enough for you to have encountered several other civilizations.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Open the game menu
2. Select the item ""Victory status""
3. Switch to the tab ""Rankings""
4. Scroll right to see the right-most column ""Culture"".

The expected result: see the actual Culture level of each civilization in the current game, like for Happiness, Technology, etc.

The actual result: every civilization always has 10 in that column.

So, this one took me a while to realize what was happening, but if my phone is what I consider upside-down-landscape, the mod filter text field operates in an intuitive way -- I get a keyboard at the bottom of my screen, and the text gets added to the input field.
If my phone is right-side-up-landscape, then when I click the filter text, I get a popup ""Enter search text"".  I can enter the text, but clicking OK doesn't update the text in the filter input, making it impossible to use.

Expected behavior would be identical behavior no matter the phone orientation.

### Steps to Reproduce

On mobile, go to mod page.  Click filter.  Turn phone upside down, click filter again.

- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### Game Version

4.13.14

### Describe the bug

When calculating a path, the pathfinder assumes the unit's current speed will be used for both embarked and land travel.  This leads to bad/slow routes, as well as incorrect destination turn estimate.

### Steps to Reproduce

Get any upgrade that gives embarked units +x to their embarked speed.
Put unit on land, view path that goes through water.  Land speed is always used.
Put unit in water, view path that goes through land.  Embarked speed is always used.

- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### Game Version

4.12.19

### Describe the bug

I have noticed that if one opens the city view via the ""Cities"" tab of the overview and changes the output of the city, the change is not reflected in the ""Cities"" tab after exiting the city afterwards. If I would have to guess, I would say that the data of the ""Cities"" tab is simply not updated when returning to it but only when it's created initially by opening the overview. I am pretty confident that it is reproducible but I have not extensively tested it out... just noticed it a few times during my initial games. I presume that tile/resource changes etc. are also not updated but since this is more subtle I probably missed it.

### Steps to Reproduce

0. Make sure to have at least one city.
1. Go to the ""Cities"" tab in the overview.
2. Click on a city's name to open its view.
3. Change the ""Current construction"" to something different.
4. Exit the city view to return to the overview.
5. Notice that the construction column still shows the previous construction.
6. Exit the overview and open it again.
7. Notice that the construction is now correct.

### Describe the bug

- I just made peace with a nation for 30 turns
- the very next turn that said nation declares war on me thru the ""join"" mechanic, means ""XXX has joined YYY in the war against us!""

First off, that's kind of weird and is not what I would expect at all from how game works or should work.
Second, when I want to exploit the same mechanic (I checked) - I cannot. I cannot propose another nation to join them in the war against a nation I just made peace with.

So this should be solved in some way. Either make this exploitable by the human player as well, or make it impossible for AI as well.

### Steps to Reproduce

- I just made peace with a nation for 30 turns
- the very next turn that said nation declares war on me thru the ""join"" mechanic, means ""XXX has joined YYY in the war against us!""

Please check out video on following link.
https://youtu.be/2VxF_MvSN18?si=1d2Fp8QT4I7BtjY8

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Start any game by quickstart, start new, load, whatever
2. Close the game by pushing back button on world screen
3. Reopen the app and wait
4. Game only shows logo. If you don't swipe it out on multitasking screen it will stay there forever.

### Additional Information

I remember this bug has been existed for really long time.

- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### Game Version

4.11.2

### Describe the bug

This bug has existed since at least 4.10.16 according to comments in the bugs discussion channel on the Discord server. Only this one specific CS quest is affected. Invest is effectively permanent once given as long as the CS isn't conquered and you don't demand tribute or get into a war with it.

Mod/ruleset dependencies: None. It can be observed on G&K, DeCiv Redux, Alpha Frontier, Rekmod, etc.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Open any saved game or start a new game.
2. Play until you see a CS assign the Invest quest and continue play for the normal duration of that quest on your game speed.
3. Observe that once it reaches the last turn for the quest, it gets stuck there and will read 0 turns left for the rest of the game, but will never expire no matter how many turns pass after it would normally expire provided the CS remains alive and unprovoked by you.

There's one obvious blunder in #11387: deselectIncompatibleMods is meant to turn disableChangeEvents on then off when it's done, but the ""off"" is a typo

### Describe the bug

At one point in the attached save, two civs offered me trades. I accepted them both, and, maybe unrelated, my happiness went up 8 points for each. The next turn, it went back, and they offered it again, while I also got notifications that the trade offers will end soon. This still goes on for more than 5 turns.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Load the attached save
2. Accept the trades
3. Go to next turn
4. The trades ended and are offered again

### Describe the bug

Automated Workers now replace Great Improvements (Customs house, Holy site, Landmark, Manufactory) with regular tile improvements.  I'm pretty sure they didn't do this in earlier versions, and I hope this is not a new feature.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Place a Great Improvement on a tile (any except snow tile) with a Great Person.
2. Set some Workers to automated
3. Eventually the automated Workers will replace the Great Improvement with the regular improvement for that tile (farm, mine, lumber mill, etc.)

The [Upside-Down mod](https://github.com/SpacedOutChicken/Upside-Down) has started failing. When you attempt to start a new game with Upside-Down as the human player's civilization, you get the old message: ""Maybe you put too many players into too small a map?"" This is in spite of the fact that the mod error finds nothing wrong with the game.

Strangely enough, the bug doesn't kick in for me when you have Upside-Down as an AI civilization. It only affects human players.

### Game Version

4.9.5

### Describe the bug

This might be me not understanding how something is supposed to operate, but most of my units that are fortified or sleeping will wake up when an enemy is nearby, putting themselves in the Next Unit queue.  Scouts seem to never do that, letting an enemy pound on them till they are destroyed.  I'd expect behavior to be consistent across units.

### Steps to Reproduce

1) Fortify a scout in barbarian territory.  
2) ...
3) Profit.

- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### Game Version

current master from source

### Describe the bug

I chose to change city ambience sounds from memory resident to _streamed_ by adding an independent ""overlay"" track to MusicController. Later I chose to to reuse that for leader voices. Pausing is meant to fade out (unless Android violently interferes), and when the pause reason ends, to fade-in and continue - which is not appropriate for Leader Voices.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Play with a Leader Voices mod until you meet some new leader
2. Do a few unrelated things - e.g. move units
3. Hit back/esc to open ""wanna quit"" popup
4. Cancel the popup and listen


### Expected Behavior

Un-pausing should not dig up finished overlay sounds, but should resume playing city ambiance tracks...

### Game Version

4.9.1

### Describe the bug

I started the game from ""Renaissance"" era. When game started, I enabled citizenship policy without having any city. Game did not give free worker and I thought it is because I have no city. Therefore, I was hoping that I will have free worker when I create my first city. Yet, I did not get free worker although I create a city. If I enable this policy while having city. It works well. However, policy does not work if I don't have any active city. 

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Go to '..start to game .'
2. Click on '.starts in era of Renaissance..'
3. Scroll down to '.without having city, enable citizen policy..'
4. See error


### Expected Behavior

In this situation, either free worker should be exist without having any city or free worker should be exist as soon as first city created. First one is much convenient, I think.

- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### Game Version

4.9.0

### Describe the bug

In a game set up for local multiplayer on the same device (couch-multiplayer), if one of the human player is defeated, and the rest of the human players decide to continue the game by choosing the `One more turn` option, the defeated player's turn will still be come but will only let him look at the stats and full cleared map of the game.
This can both slow the game for remaining players and be a potential for cheating as they are given access to the dead player's ""spectator"" view.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Set up an offline game with multiple human players
2. Play until one of the player loses (do it quickly: exploring early and declaring war to all encountered civs and citystates without retaliating)
3. On the End Game screen during that player's turn, choose the `One more turn` option.
4. Play until the defeated player's turn comes again

### Expected Behavior

To tge deheated player, the game could show the revealed map and all player's stats once. But once the option to continue the gane has been chosen, that player's turn shouldn't come again.

Android, 12, 32-bit

**Version**
F-Droid 4.2.13

**Describe the bug**
After nuking a capital city (carthage), fallout was placed on some tiles, including a Desert Hill with a citadel on top of it. The citadel's tile was rendered however as a Desert Hill (again), and I _think_ the 100% damage reduction was also not counted, but not 100% sure on that. After removing fallout, the tile was functioning normally again.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Place citadel in fallout region of a city to be nuked
2. Nuke city
3. Unsee citadel
4. Remove fallout
5. See citadel

<details><summary>Saved game</summary>

```
N/A
```
</details>

**Expected behavior**
I would expect that the citadel be at least rendered normally (with fallout on top) it also should still somewhat function? Potentially even protect units."

This one is either a minor textual oddity or a minor bug, and may or may not be worth fixing, but when using salt cube +3 the 'well fed' buff turns remaining counter ticks down every other turn, instead of every turn, but the duration then ticks down by 2.

So, for example, it might say ""17 turns remaining."" Take one step, still says ""17 turns."" Take another step, now says ""15 turns."""

Trying to attack a succubus from range with a ranged melee weapon, while charmed by it, will make you move towards it. I would expect it to do nothing. The succubus is in attack range, you just can't attack it. I don't see what moving towards it is achieving - it feels like a bug to me.

The Posts tab of Search/Explore keep loading indefinitely, showing no posts, until I tap on Hashtag and then go back to Posts.
With this workaround it completes loading almost immediately.

(I am on mastodon.social but I checked also via web and it's not an issue of my server)

**To reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Close and reopen the app (to clear the affected tab content)
2. Go to 'Search'
3. Click on 'Posts' tab
4. See it won't load
5. Click on 'Hashtags' tab
6. Click on 'Posts' tab again and now it works

**Does this happen in the official app?**
Does this issue also occur with the respective upstream release?
> No, not on Mastodon nor Megalodon (although on Megalodon Hashtags is opened as first tab)

When I go to the notifications tab, only the text ""This list is empty"" appear under Everything (see screenshot). When I swipe down (the refresh gesture) the notifications appear. Another way to do let them appear is to click on the filter icon and click Save (all boxes are checked). The Mentions tab works like it should.

After I close Moshidon and re-open it, the notifications tab appear empty again. Even when the number of new notifications are on the 🔔 icon, there is still nothing below the Notifications > Everything tab.

**To reproduce**

See above.

No (also not in Megalodon afaik)

Marking individual items as read in an rss feed works fine, and it get its automatically marked as ready when downloaded. However, this does not work in the combined ""view all"" feed folders, which group all rss feeds together. This is whether it's a manually created folder for certain feeds or the main ""view all"" folder for everything. Manually marking as read does nothing, and downloading doesn't mark as read either. Only using the mark all read button on top works, however that marks all feeds in that folder as read, which is not always desirable.

1. Boot in dev mode or turn on dev mode (not entirely sure this is needed)

5. Run the program again with `^R` and wait for it to exit
6. Hit `^R` to rerun the program from the command line
7. Hit `Esc` and verify it doesn't work anymore even if held down

Closing the window via the 'x' button does bring up the menu asking if I want to lose my unsaved changes, but hitting 'no' doesn't make `Esc` work again so the only thing I can do is select 'yes' and wish I'd saved a tad more often.

I had 2 bookmarks and after going back and forth between editors my code was randomly jumping between this two bookmarks.

Mix the traffic3. Redirect the trafficThis process is done up to 5 times (5-hops) and makes it impossible for anyone to monitor or track your online activity.This is why you should choose our decentralized, secure, and private VPNPrivacyOur dVPN was built with privacy in mind. We don't store logs (no-logs policy) nor track your activity. Even if someone wanted to steal your data from us, there would be nothing to steal.Censorship resistanceOur VPN app makes your online activity completely anonymous. We encrypt your traffic, IP address, location and everything that someone with bad intentions could monitor. You are completely safe also thanks to features like the killswitch.SpeedThe speed of our VPN network grows by the minute thanks to many additional nodes joining the Mixnet network. Moreover, we use modern cryptographic algorithms and innovative protocols such as Sphinx and Loopix to make your connection as fast as possible.Location of choiceWith NymVPN you can choose to connect from hundreds of locations around the world.Download the app --> Choose the location --> ConnectCrypto paymentsYou are looking for a VPN that accepts crypto payments? Here we are. We are happy to accept payments with cryptocurrencies.No-adsEnjoy your VPN ads-free. Our main goal is to protect your privacy, also because of this you won't see any ads in our VPN app.Limitless usageEnjoy the internet as much as you want, NymVPN will never limit your traffic.Our VPN most beloved features:- 5-hop Mixnet: your internet traffic will be encrypted and sent to mixnodes that will mix it with other traffic packages 5 times, making it impossible for someone to track your online activity.- 2-hop dVPN: in this case your traffic is encrypted and sent to 2 mixnodes that will mix it. The reduced number of hops results in higher speed.- No centralized logs: we don't store any activity logs, this makes it impossible for anyone to have access to your internet activity through us.- Money-back guarantee: if you are not happy with the product we offer a money-back guarantee policy.

I used to have a main VPN connection on my main profile (owner user profile), and a work one, for proprietary apps mainly (Work Profile using Shelter). and then I'm also able to use a different DNS using custom DNS settings in that VPN app.

So both VPN connections, and both apps are on always mode, kill switch on, etc on android vpn settings. (I also use that for Private Space btw)

But when I tried to install NymVPN on the work profile, it was in conflict with the main profile, saying that there's already one VPN or similar.
Switching off the VPN from the main profile, NymVPN allows me to connect, but it connect to the whole device (main profile), and not only the Work Profile.

I know that, in the settings, there's no setup for DNS except the main profile, but VPN connectons are possible, seeing the work logo (nothing for the main profile, a shield for private space one) in the VPN settings of Android.

What could cause it ? Is it something intended, or like a bug ? Or I'm just missing something ?

edit : is it related to https://trello.com/c/BGk4krt6/80-%F0%9F%9A%A7-android-run-nymvpn-in-several-spaces ?
edit 2 : Does that means to route all the phone, or only a profile or work profile or private space is up to the VPN app, not to Android ? Like the app choose how it works and how it implements it ?"

I have an actionable notification which I want to direct me to a lovelace page when clicked. The action URI button works as expected and opens the specified page when clicked. However when I tap on the main part of the notification, it brings me to my default dashboard instead of the URL I have specified under the data field. I have the exact same syntax sending a notification to an iOS device and this syntax opens the correct lovelace page when clicked. This feature is barely mentioned in the documentation and I am wondering if this is a bug or a deprecated feature (See: [Actionable Notifications: Migrating from Categories](https://companion.home-assistant.io/docs/notifications/actionable-notifications/#migrating-from-categories) and look under the #replacement comment in the code).

Is this simply an Android bug? Should the documentation be updated?

Autotunnelling doesn't switch between Profile correctly

So, I'm currently having 3 situations with 3 different VPN settings:

- At home
- At work
- Everywhere else

Auto-tunnel set like this:

1. Add the Home Wifi SSIDs to the Automatic Tunnel settings of the Home Profile 
2. Add the Work Wifi SSID to the Automatic Tunnel settings of the Work Profile 
3. Set the Everywhere profile as Primary, also selecting Mobile Data Tunnel in its Autotunnel settings

What I expected:

- Home Profile activating when I'm connected to the Home Wifi, Work Profile activating when I'm connected to the Work Wifi, Everywhere Else Profile being active in every other situation

What Happens:

""Everywhere"" does activate when there is no wifi connected, but:

- deactivates when I'm connecting to any WiFi
- neither the Home or Work profile activate when I'm connected to the relative WiFi.

I'm trying to set up a tunnel. Using the painful method (Create from scratch).

So basically this takes quite a while to fill out. You have to type stuff, copy paste stuff, perhaps switch between apps so you can copy from/to a messenger.

Suddenly all input fields are empty. :sweat: All those inputs lost... like tears in the rain...

First time I didn't realize what happened and I started over... second time again... third time... I finally realize this happens when the display rotates. Holding the phone slightly wrong and bam, everything gone. And so I turn off auto-rotate...

- [x] I know this is an issue with the app, and contacting Mullvad support is not relevant.

### I have checked if others have reported this already

- [x] I have checked the issue tracker to see if others have reported similar issues.

### Current Behavior

The installation kept failing on me, even with sufficient permissions. Turns out, my system did not have a `/Library/LaunchDaemons/` directory. Potentially the folder got removed by CleanMyMac or a similar tool.

Doing a `sudo mkdir /Library/LaunchDaemons/` and then re-running the install let it go through.

### Expected Behavior

The install scripts should create the parent directory `/Library/LaunchDaemons/` automatically if it doesn't exist, yet.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Delete `/Library/LaunchDaemons/` (assuming this is empty for you right now)
2. Install the mac app

When trying to send a file with characters permitted on sender's OS, but illegal on receiver's OS, it errors with:
- Sender: `[500] Could not save file`
- Receiver: `PathAccessException: Cannot open file, path = '/bla/bla/my:cool:video.mp4' (OS Error: Operation not permitted, errno = 1)`

The error does not occur if `my:cool:video.mp4` is renamed to `my_cool_video.mp4`.

### To reproduce

1. Create a file with some funky characters that are illegal on the receiver's OS

```
my:cool:file.txt
```

2. Send this file to the receiver
3. Gaze upon the error messages on both devices

### Expected behavior

It should probably replace illegal characters with underscores, since most operating systems allow them in filenames. It would also be nice if the user was notified beforehand when the file will be renamed on the receiver's end.

**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

I am using freerdp via the Vinagre package in my recently installed OpenSUSE Leap 15.6 Linux. The versions are:
```
libfreerdp2-2-2.11.2-150600.4.3.1.x86_64
vinagre-3.22.0-bp156.4.7.x86_64
```

I start vinagre, provide the RDP details to connect to a Windows machine and then I click on connect. Then I get a black screen with a colorful first line. If I check the journalctl logs, I see:

Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Write a Debian image for raspberry pi
2. Build sdl client 
3. attempt to connect to host with /multimon
4. 2 windows overlap each other

**Expected behavior**
a full screen (borderless) window on each of the available monitors

I checked the latest prebuild on windows and it does something similar but both windows launch in windowed mode and can't swap to Fullscreen.

Is this a bug or is SDL multimon simply not fully implemented??"

I have 2 RDP sessions with Freerdp 3.7.
When I copy from session 1 to session 2, nothing is copied and vice versa.

But if I copy from session 1, paste it locally and then copy it locally and copy it to session 2, it works without problems.

I can copy back and forth from local to both sessions

I just can't copy between 2 RDP sessions.

I have tested this with Word, Excel, Browser Link, Wordpad etc.

Pressing the right control key twice in an X11 FreeRDP session - not just in quick succession, but under *any* circumstances, including when separated by an arbitrary number of other key presses - causes the FreeRDP window to lose focus.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior (assumes Windows RDP server, Linux RDP client, and that Alt+Tab performs a window switch on both local and remote window managers):
1. Open a couple of X11 windows on the client (anything, e.g. xterm or whatever).
2. Initiate a fullscreen FreeRDP connection to a Windows RDP server.
3. In the Windows desktop, open a couple of windows (anything, e.g. notepad or whatever).
4. Press Alt+Tab and verify that remote window switching behavior occurs.
5. Press and release the RCtrl (right control) key.
6. Wait a second or two then press and release the 'a' key.
7. Press and release the RCtrl key again.
8. Press Alt+Tab again - local window switching behavior will be observed, i.e. FreeRDP window has lost keyboard focus.

**Expected behavior**
The FreeRDP window should still have keyboard focus, and therefore remote window switching behavior should be observed.  It would be OK if a double-tap of RCtrl were deliberately intended to ungrab focus, but FreeRDP should not do so with seconds between RCtrl key presses and/or an intervening keystroke.

In freerdp 3.2 versions, I have a problem when freerdp reading the password from a file that does not have a line break (\n)

**For example:**

cat /tmp/password_tmp | xfreerdp /u:test /title:""Test"" /d:test.test /smartcard /p:""test"" /v:localhost:3389 /size:100%  /cert:ignore

In freerdp 3.2 versions, defining empty variables as HTTPS_PROXY/https_proxy makes freerdp believe that there is a proxy configured in the environment and fails to launch it.


**For example:**

/u:test /title:""Test"" /d:test.test /smartcard /p:""test"" /v:localhost:3389 /size:100%  /cert:ignore
![image](https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/assets/25820234/1de949e7-afd8-40ba-93b7-3fe328f79c3a)

part of the env command output:

HTTPS_PROXY=
https_proxy=

I have verified that by unsetting these variables, freerdp can now connect to the server directly without problems.

For me, this is a irregular behavior in parse environment variables and I wonder if allowing definition of those empty variables could be resolved.

I am using freerdp-shadow-cli to implement a RDP shadow server under Linux (I am using X11). I am trying to connect from a Windows 10 machine by using the stock RDP client (mstsc.exe 10.0.19041.3636). Both computers are in the same LAN..

I am using the following command line to start the server as a regular user

`$ freerdp-shadow-cli /sec:nla /sam-file:/etc/freerdp/SAM /port:9833  /log-level:TRACE

Sometimes I am able to connect from the client but I noticed the reported error indicated in the title of this issue. Other times instead the client cannot connect because the process is closed during evaluation of connection quality, in that case the error is the following:

`Because of a protocol error, this session will be disconnected. Please try connecting to the remote computer again.`

I don't know if this client error is related to the server error because the _invalid TPKT header error_ always appears in the server log even when the connection is successful.

I have also tried running remmina, based on freerdp2, from a Linux virtual machine (Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS) installed on the same Windows machine used for the tests. In this case I don't see the same error in the server so I guess there is some incompatibility with the Microsoft client. Moreover the connection is reliably established and I don't get problems as reported above with the Windows client.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. start the server as indicated above on the Linux machine
2. use the windows RDP client to connect to the server (accept the invalid certificate)

**Expected behavior**
I expect to connect to the server without problems with the Windows client (every time I try).

`-grab-keyboard` option is not making effect.

I made [this debug change](https://github.com/recolictest/FreeRDP/commit/fe2bc9002dda713b0abf4cd79f44b20c8e1d895e) to print  `xfc->grab_keyboard`. 

And then, I run `./client/X11/xfreerdp -u test -p test -v test.recolic.net -grab-keyboard`.

## To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Make [this debug change](https://github.com/recolictest/FreeRDP/commit/fe2bc9002dda713b0abf4cd79f44b20c8e1d895e) to print  `xfc->grab_keyboard`. Build project from source.
2. Run `./client/X11/xfreerdp -u test -p test -v test.recolic.net -grab-keyboard`
3. Observe debug message

## Expected behavior

```

Using Windows 10 Pro and a registered copy of Office 2021 Pro Plus, I am unable to resize columns or rows.
Hovering over the column or row edges shows the resize icon but holding and dragging doesn't do anything.
Resizing works fine when opening a full RDP session though.
In app mode, I can resize margins in Word.

**Expected behavior**
I expect to be able to resize the columns or rows in app mode similar to full desktop mode.

When using Remote Apps, some apps like Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop don't have their icons in the Linux host taskbar when launched while others like Microsoft Excel and Word do. This makes application management difficult for me since I can't maximize them if I ever minimize them. 

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. On Windows Guest ungroup programs in the taskbar (I'm not sure if this does anything but I'll mark this anyways)
2. In the Linux Host terminal run ```xfreerdp /u:[user] /p:[pass] /app:""C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop 2021\Photoshop.exe"" /v:[ip]``` to launch Photoshop (or any other problematic application)
3. The application starts as expected but its icon doesn't show in the Linux Host taskbar

**Expected behavior**
For the icon to show in the taskbar that allows me to minimize, maximize, etc.

**Screenshots**
I've attached two screen shots. One with Photoshop which shows the problem I'm trying to describe (the taskbar at the bottom lacks the Photoshop icon) and another with Word which shows the expected behaviour (there's the Word icon in the taskbar)

First off - apologies for the very general bug title. I've tried to find similar reports, but only one seems to come close: https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/issues/5937

I'm trying to connect to my employer's remote desktop (I think on Windows Server 2019). The connection goes through a gateway and has MFA (OAuth2) enabled. The main problem: my connection very rarely goes through successfully, I'd guess about 1 in 20 to 30 times. Looking at logs I tried to take, it appears to fail in two different ways. First, it very often fails very soon, with the log (anonymised) ending as follows:

```

[15:03:23:332] [24350:24351] [ERROR][com.freerdp.core.connection] - Error: protocol security negotiation or connection failure
```
Sometimes the connection does seem to authorise correctly, but then I get the same error about eight minutes.

Of note: I first need to enter my credentials, then I need to approve the connection on my phone with microsoft's authenticator app, then, after quite some time, I'm prompted again by the authenticator app, either nothing happens, or, very rarely, the connection goes through.

**To Reproduce**
I'm downloading a profile from my employers myapps page:

`user@host:~$ WLOG_LEVEL=TRACE xfreerdp ~/profile.rdp
`

**Expected behavior**
I expect my remote desktop window to open up :-)

**Describe the bug**

I have windows server where i connect and work on (from 17 Computers, last 10 years)
Now what i am trying is connecting to same server over linux.
I connect to remote desktop with `xfreerdp /v:server` and everything is working. Problem is one of the programs (main one i use) is not working as intended. Problem is when i press button in that program, inside it small border **2px wide red colored** appears. That border is not visible on xfreerdp (when i connect through windows Remote Desktop it works). Now i came to conclusion it has to do something with refreshing since when i press button, border should appear but it didn't, but when i click and move that window or resize it, then border appears.

Under are 4 screenshots and they are in this order of actions done:

WindowWithoutBorder
WindowAfterPressingButton - border should have been visible
WindowAfterResizing - border should have been visible but it is partially rendered
windowAfterResizingAgain - this is how it should look like

When you do so, a window containing information about the url is displayed, allowing you to make changes to it as well.Specially useful when you need to open an external link either from an email, a social network app or others.URLCheck is developed by TrianguloY, originally for personal use. It is open source (under CC BY 4.0 license), free, without any ads or trackers, light sized and using as few permissions as necessary (only the internet permission, for module checks that will only be performed when the user request them). The source code is available on GitHub too, if you want to suggest changes, perform modifications or propose a new translation: https://github.com/TrianguloY/URLCheckThe app is structured with a modular setup, you can enable/disable and reorder individual modules, which include:* Input text: Displays the current url which can be edited manually. Can't be disabled.* History: View and revert any change from other modules, including edits from the user (typical undo/redo feature)* Log: Keeps a log of all checked urls, which you can view, edit, copy, clear...* Status code: By pressing the button a network request will be made to retrieve that url, and the status code will be displayed (ok, server error, not found...). Additionally, if it corresponds to a redirection, press the message to check the new url. The url is fetched, but not evaluated, so redirection based on javascript won't be detected.* Url Scanner: Allows you to scan the url using VirusTotal, and check the report. A free personal VirusTotal API key is needed for it to work. VirusTotal™ is a trademark of Google, Inc.* Url Cleaner: Uses the ClearURLs catalog to remove referral and useless parameters from the url. It also allows for common offline url redirections. Built-in catalog from https://docs.clearurls.xyz/latest/specs/rules/* Unshortener: Uses https://unshorten.me/ to unshorten urls remotely.* Queries remover: Displays the decoded individual url queries, which you can remove or check.* Pattern module: Checks the url with regex patterns that warns, suggests or applies replacements. You can modify or create your own patterns, or even use user-created ones.Built-in patterns include:- Warning when contains non-ascii characters like greek letters. This can be used for phishing: googĺe.com vs google.com- Suggest replacing 'http' with 'https'- Suggest replacing Youtube, Reddit or Twitter with privacy-friendly alternatives [disabled by default]* Hosts checker: This module labels hosts, configured either by specifying them manually or by using a remote hosts-like file. You can use it to warn about dangerous or special sites. The builtin configuration specifies StevenBlack's hosts (adware/malware, fakenews, gambling and adult content) from https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts* Debug module: Displays the intent uri, and optionally info about the ctabs (custom tabs) service.

Can't be disabled.",connectivity,https://github.com/TrianguloY/URLCheck/issues/238,Auto close the application after opening or sharing the link,"Hi, I think the new update caused a bug.

**Describe the bug**
I communicate from my app to the StrongSwan app. Importing a profile works fine, as does disconnecting from a connected VPN.
However, trying to connect to the VPN by sending an intent of START_PROFILE to VpnProfileControlActivity always gives me ""Profile not found""
Connecting manually by using the StrongSwan app works fine.
I've traced through the source code, and it would appear I'm sending the wrong UUID. But when I edit the profile it's got the same one I sent as the Profile ID.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Use an intent to import a profile
2. Use an intent to connect

**Expected behavior**
The connection occurs instead of an error message

There are currently many instances that serve instance pages via a reverse proxy on non-instance domains for various reasons. For example, if an instance's domain name is `aaa.com`, it could potentially be served at `bbb.com` or `123.aaa.com`. Using Aria in this case will result in incorrect host issues, which can cause a number of anomalies and inconveniences.
The solution is that you should get the real instance domain name from `(domain)/api/meta`

### 🥰 Expected Behavior

see above

### 🤬 Actual Behavior

Users that are supposed to be `123@aaa.com` are incorrectly shown as `123@bbb.com` or `123@123.aaa.com`

### 📝 Steps to Reproduce

Use the non-instance domain (in this case is `bbb.com` or `123.aaa.com`) and login.

**App Version:**
2023.2.0

**Affected Device(s):**
Samsung Galaxy J5 with Android 10 (Lineage OS)

**Describe the bug**
Rust macros like #[derive] only go up to the next ']', so macros like logos::regex (e.g #[regex(""[0-9]"")]) are kind of broken (in the case o regex especifically, since the app thinks the macro is just #[regex(""[0-9] the other quote becomes a never ending string)

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Try to use a macro with another pair of square brackets inside

**Expected behavior**
The syntax highlighting should only stop considering the macro once the respective square bracket is met

**Affected Device(s):**
Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro, de-fanged (as in 'removed anything suspected of leaking data) MIUI Global 11.0.3, Android 9, 440dpi, XS font

**Describe the bug**
When using the ""Force Syntax"" option to forcibly get the editor to syntax highlight a recalcitrant XML file I noticed the menu is partly obscured by something invisible which hovers over the centre of the screen. This something hides the text for the majority of the options in the menu as well as the title of the menu itself, the latter can be made to appear and disappear by scrolling upwards. Scrolling the menu makes the text appear at the bottom 4 lines and just the top line of the menu, in between are 14 options without text (I use a tiny font so the menu contains 19 visible options).

This is what it looks like:

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open editor on my device and navigate to  Tools -> Force Syntax
2. Notice that most of the text seems to be missing but that it is possible to make it appear by scrolling the menu so the text ends up on the lower side of the display

**Expected behavior**
All text in the menu should be visible, there should not be anything obscuring it

Hello, I apologize if this is a misuse of the app, but I understood that the app would start as soon as I clicked or copied a song link. However, this has not happened, when I click the Firefox browser opens and when I copy, nothing happens. The only way I found to open the app was to copy the link, paste and share it with the app. I would like to know if this is normal or if I need to do some more configuration. I am using it on a Redmi Note 13.

### Expected behavior

Click or copy a link and a popup from the app appears.

### Affected app version

1.1.0

### Affected Android/Custom ROM version

EMUI 11  non rooted/no custom version

### Affected device model

Huawei P Smart 2019

### How did you install the app?

GitHub releases

### Steps to reproduce the bug

1. Install the Fossify Contacts App on the source Android Phone
2. Export All contacts at one from all listed accounts to .vcf file
3. Install the Fossify Contacts App on the target Android Phone
4. Import the .vcf file

The intended target phone would not have an active Google Account
The aim is to use an Android phone without having to share my contacts inside a Google Account

Application displays a warning that imported contacts will be saved onto ""Phone"":

<img alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60a42d83-630d-4f50-9a6f-ffa3fa41b9a7"" width=184 />

5. Only App Fossify Contacts has access to imported contacts: Import is successful 

Bug: why other apps (SMS App: [QUIK](https://github.com/octoshrimpy/quik) for example) can't access contacts and thus can't associate SMS numbers with contacts. Although it has been granted access to all necessary permissions: Contacts, SMS, even Calls and Storage

### Expected behavior

All Apps with granted permissions should have access to contacts, not just Fossify applications

### Actual behavior

Only App Fossify Contacts and Fossify Messages have access to imported contacts

### Screenshots/Screen recordings

Pressing ""Join Meeting"" causes the self-view to dim and a spinner to display over the center of the screen.

There is no other information presented to the user.  The spinner will probably spin forever.

The correct behavior would be to:

*  detect the network situation
* report it to the user
* since it's a captive portal compliant with the standards to publish itself, either:
    * redirect to the Wifi network / captive portal login page
    * notify the user of the need to log in to the network with an error
 
It would be really nice if there would be some network debugging information visible in the app.  Like tell me if I have connectivity to the next hop, if I have an IP on the internet or not, if I can reach local DNS, if I can reach 8.8.4.4 style global DNS, etc.  In a way that lets me get this information over the phone from a non-technical person that is looking at a screen that I can't see."

### Description:

<!-- Please describe the bug clearly and concisely. -->

I am the maintainer of a jitsi-meet infrastructure. The configuration is such that to create a new conference you have to authenticate against our corporate LDAP server. That make the first user to be a moderator. Following users join in without such a privilege and without having to authenticate (unless we setup a password). If they want to gain moderators rights by themselves they have to login. They are ale to login, but they have to reload to be able to use the moderator functions.

### Steps to reproduce:

1. <!-- Open '...' --> Open Settings
2. <!-- Click on '...' --> Go to Profile
3. <!-- and so on... --> Click on the Login blue button inside Authenticate
4. The login dialog appears
5. Enter the data

### Expected behavior:

<!-- Please describe what should happen. -->

The login dialog disappears and the user is now a moderator

### Actual behavior:

<!-- Please describe what actually happens. -->
<!-- Please attach screenshot if possible. -->

The login dialog remains visible. If the user reloads, the call recognizes them as moderators.

### Description:

Hi Jitsi Team,
I’ve using Jitsi Meet Mobile SDK 6.3.6 and developing my own native toolbox and listening for native events emitted for my button icon, status, and function. One of the methods I used is screenShareToggled. But later when I update to Jitsi Meet Mobile SDK 8.1.2 that method never gets triggered anymore.

I check on mobile/external-api/middleware.js and the code still there. I don’t see any code change

```
StateListenerRegistry.register(
    /* selector */ state => state['features/base/tracks'],
    /* listener */ debounce((tracks, store) => {
        const oldScreenShares = store.getState()['features/mobile/external-api'].screenShares || [];
        const newScreenShares = tracks
            .filter(track => track.mediaType === 'video' && track.videoType === 'desktop')
            .map(track => track.participantId);

        oldScreenShares.forEach(participantId => {
            if (!newScreenShares.includes(participantId)) {
                sendEvent(
                    store,
                    SCREEN_SHARE_TOGGLED,
                    /* data */ {
                        participantId,
                        sharing: false
                    });
            }
        });

        newScreenShares.forEach(participantId => {
            if (!oldScreenShares.includes(participantId)) {
                sendEvent(
                    store,
                    SCREEN_SHARE_TOGGLED,
                    /* data */ {
                        participantId,
                        sharing: true
                    });
            }
        });

        store.dispatch(setParticipantsWithScreenShare(newScreenShares));

    }, 100));
```
<!-- Please describe the bug clearly and concisely. -->

### Steps to reproduce:

1. On the mobile (android/ios) press start screen share/ stop screen share 

### Expected behavior:

screenShareToggled method will be triggered on the native side of the app
<!-- Please describe what should happen. -->

### Actual behavior:

screenShareToggled never get triggered
<!-- Please describe what actually happens. -->
<!-- Please attach screenshot if possible. -->

### Description:

<!-- Please describe the bug clearly and concisely. -->

![Jitsi 3 dots menu overflow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119020198/210644551-42ce14b2-11f2-44fc-940b-dbed7aa83738.png)

The 3 dots menu goes up and off the screen when using Firefox with a scaled display. This is inconvenient because you cannot click on the top-most items that have been cutoff:
- Profile
- Invite people
- Performance settings

The only way to click on them is to zoom out of the webpage, or change your scaling settings.

Context:
Many people use their computer with scaled displays for different reasons. (Inconvenient resolution for laptop screen form factor, bad eyesight, etc). The screen can be scaled via system settings, or application interfaces scaled. This bug report is about scaling Firefox's application display.

### Steps to reproduce:

1. Open Firefox
2. Navigate to `about:config`
3. Change `ui.textScaleFactor` = 150
4. Navigate to `meet.jit.si` and start a new meeting
5. Click on 3 dots menu

### Expected behavior:

The 3 dots menu should become scrollable, if the menu goes off the screen. This way, the user can access and click on all the items.

Another alternative is for the menu items to stack in multiple columns so that all of them can fit on the screen at the same time.

### Actual behavior:

<!-- Please describe what actually happens. -->
<!-- Please attach screenshot if possible. -->

The the top part of the 3 dots menu is off the screen

### Server information:
Using https://meet.jit.si on Jan 4, 2023. Not sure how to find version #.

### Client information:

- Browser / app version: Firefox 108.0.1
- Operating System: Linux Mint 21.1

### Description:

<!-- Please describe the bug clearly and concisely. -->
When sharing your screen from an iOS (15.6) device, the `RTCView` that displays the stream locally shows a red screen.
I've also noticed the same issue on a demo app I've created very similar to [this one](https://github.com/irohitb/screenshare-webrtc).

With the same demo app on Android, I do get the hall of mirrors effect, but on iOS, for some reason, it just shows a red screen.

### Steps to reproduce:

1. Open Jitsi-Meet on iPhone device
2. Connect to a conference room
3. Start screen sharing

### Expected behavior:

<!-- Please describe what should happen. -->
Like Android, I'd expect to see a hall-of-mirrors effect on the local `RTCView`.

### Actual behavior:

<!-- Please describe what actually happens. -->
Instead, we get a straight red screen. Below is a screenshot of the iOS app with the issue exposed.

<!-- Please attach screenshot if possible. -->

### Server information:

- Jitsi Meet version: N/A
- Operating System: N/A

### Client information:

- Browser / app version: 22.4.0 build 1657277707
- Operating System: iOS 15.6

### Additional information:

<!-- Please provide additional information about the bug, if any. -->
I've also created a very similar demo app that, instead of displaying the screen capture locally, it uses PeerJS to share the stream to a remote device.
In that case, I can see the iPhone screen fine on the remote device. So, this seems to be an issue when displaying the screen capture on a local `RTCView`.
Not sure if this is an iOS restriction to prevent hall-of-mirrors, or if it's a bug, hence the creation of this issue.

### Description:

When the participant context menu opens above the participants' name, depending on the position of the participant and the number of options, the context menu won't scroll up to access the all the options. 

### Steps to reproduce:

1. Open a meeting in meet.jit.si.
2. Join with several participants.
3. Decrease the browser height so that the context menu will open above a participant's name.
4. Have the selected participant unmute and start video so the max amount of options are available. Maybe open some breakout rooms too.

### Expected behavior:

The context menu should be able to be scrolled all the way to the top.

### Actual behavior:

In the screenshot below from meet.jit.si, the Mute Everyone Else and Mute options for the selected participant at the top of the context menu can't be accessed. (Also Stop Video is slightly cut off.) Scrolling down still works however.

#### What happened instead?
Indefinite loading of the sticker picker view. Works fine after downgrading to 1.5.11. Also, unrelated but I don't want to make another PR for this and it's technically not a bug: can you revert the image viewer to the pre-1.5.18 behaviour? What I mean is that when I open an image if I slide down on the image a little I used to be able to see the chat window and messages behind it but now it's blank and this means that whenever I view a video or photo file if I'm scrolled up in the chat after exiting the photo/video I'll immediately be jumped to the bottom and lose my position in the chat

- [X] I have read and agree to adhere to the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/oxen-io/session-android/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Describe the Bug

I've experienced that whenever a voice message it's playing, if I decide to remove it (and do something else), the same keeps playing in the background.

> Not sure if this could be considered a bug, but I think the voice message should stop playing from the moment it's removed.

## To Reproduce

1. Tell someone to send you a (not so short) voice message — or just send one to yourself
2. Play the voice message to listen to it
3. Remove it right away
4. Enjoy the voice message in the background until it finishes :wink:

When reconnecting to the internet, or switching networks between data and wifi, Session doesn't reconnect to the network immediately. It will reconnect after several minutes, perhaps a half hour.

### Steps to reproduce
- Disconnect and reconnect to the internet

No messages come in. Network indicator icon Session shows disconnected.

**Expected result:**
When connecting to the internet in previous versions of Session, it would reconnect to the Loki network within about a minute. I have not upgraded nor made system changes to my device.

**Thoughts**
Perhaps this is a result of some change to make the client more battery efficient?

**Describe the bug**

When I use recovery phrase on new device or switch device, all message's deleted by auto delete mode are back again, my messages and my contact messages. That is, if someone puts the recovery phrase on a new device, the messages I thought would be deleted will reappear, including photos, videos, voice messages, etc. If bandits or the police or oppressive government of a country have access to my device, where the Session password is mandatory the password of the device, will my messages and the people I mentioned are compromised? Where is the much-publicized privacy of this app? You user want to check? Take new device and put your recovery phrase and you will see all your old message's again!! That's terrible!

**To reproduce**

Take new session installation and put recovery phrase. Done. All your secure messages will appear again and you fuck**.

**Describe the bug**

I installed Session on two devices from F-Droid (Izzy Repository) and I can only send messages one way. On the phone on which I can send messages I cannot receive the username of my opponent, but I can receive messages on the device that fails to send messages back.

So, the affected device is unable to upload data, but it can download data. 

Sent messages show the `...` icon and the contact name of the affected device is just the SessionID on other devices (thus, the username is not uploaded as well)

**To reproduce**

Steps to reproduce the behavior:

- Adding the session ID of the working device on the affected device by scanning the QR code (which works, because it's only downloading)
- Receiving messages (which works on affected device)
- Replying with a message (which does not work, because it's uploading)

OR

- Adding the session ID of the affected device on the working device (does not work, because the affected device cannot upload to the loki network)

**Describe the bug**

If you do an account restore, you will have all the disappeared messages back.

This issue can be reproduced on iOS, Android, and macOS. I have not tested Windows version yet. 

**To reproduce**

1. Send someone with some messages which have the disappearing timer set to like 30 seconds.
2. Wait until they disappeared on both sides.
3. Log out the account: Settings - Clear Data - Delete - Device Only.
4. Re-login to the account using the recovery phrase (actually I don't understand the difference between ""Continue You Session"" and ""Link a Device"" while re-logging-in. I tested both  and the issue remains the same).
5. You will find all the messages which are supposed to disappear come back. The timer for them are reset to what you set before.

I suspect this issue is not platform-specific, but has something to do with the underlying message disappearing mechanism. Does the nodes keeps the messages forever without checking or deleting them?"

I can see, that the ble device is sending data, and that in general die android device is capable receiving (tested with Serial Bluethooth App). But XCSoar connects to the Sensor Box and than claims ""no Data"". 

Steps to reproduce the behavior
-------------------------------
I cant debug it right now, because the docker image for build ANDROID is broken, or am I missing something?
I tested several ble devices, all with the same problem, ""no Data""


Expected behavior
-----------------
Simply start xcs, then start the bluetooth sensor box and go fly...

Actual behavior
---------------
xcs connects to the ble device, than claims ""no Data"" 


Do you have any idea what may have caused this?
-----------------------------------------------
Maybe changes in xcs GATT implementation?


Do you have an idea how to solve the issue?

Do other ble sensors have trouble too?"

## Description and/or steps/code to reproduce the problem

I want to keep the current position not in the center of the screen but at the bottom, like most applications do.
The problem is when the bearing is not 0, and I see the exact same behavior described in the (solved) issue #1348.

Specifically, my code is like

        if (followMe) {
            float bearing = 20;  // just to test with a bearing != 0, in reality this is ""correct""
            mapView.setMapOrientation(bearing);
            mapView.setExpectedCenter(currentLocation, 0, (long) (mapView.getHeight() / 2 * 0.7));
        }

Somehow, it seems like the entire map, including the direction arrow at the bottom of the screen are rotating around the center of the screen, although I am not sure this is really what is happening.

Am I missing something?

## Bug report
### Describe the bug

I have recorded a large opus stream file that has non-zero startup time. mpd can not seek the file. VLC can seek the file. If I create a new file by `ffmpeg -i old.opus -c:a copy new.opus` mpd can seek it.

If I run `ffprobe -show_streams` for the old and new file, there is a difference in the output:

```
$ diff old new
19,22c19,22
< start_pts=27172852480
< start_time=566101.093333
< duration_ts=45847607680

> TAG:ENCODER=Lavf57.83.100
```

Note: not using curl storage.

## Expected Behavior

Expect to be able to seek using a client.

## Actual Behavior

Seeking does not work. For example 

```
$ mpc seek +00:00:01
Seek amount would seek past the end of the song

When trying to `get info` for a movie, I don't get movie posters. Other parts of the info seem to be loaded, but movie posters are not loaded.

Its much easier picking a movie with displayed posters.

### Steps to reproduce the issue

Select a movie, delete the current info from it and hit `get info`. You should see multiple infos you can choose from which were scraped, but none of those have posters.

### Expected behavior

I would expect that the movie poster will be loaded alongside other info data.

Resuming Issue on Google TV,"### Problem description

When I binge-watch multiple episodes of a TV series and have to pause the player due to other commitments, it restarts from the first episode of that viewing session upon resuming. This issue **only** occurs if the Google TV has entered screen saver mode in the meantime; otherwise, it continues from where it was paused. In essence, if you leave the player paused for too long, allowing the Google TV to activate its screen saver, this problem arises. I'm unsure whether this is a bug with Nova or a limitation of Google TV.

### Steps to reproduce the issue

Watching multiple episodes back-to-back, pausing the player, and then resuming the video after a half hour break.

### Expected behavior

The player always resumes playback from where it was last stopped.""

This bug is not unique to this version of Nova; the same issue was also present in version 5. Therefore, I'm wondering if it might be a limitation of the Google TV Ambient Mode.

Hi,
I am using my FritzBox 7590 AX also also as NAS with the embedded functionality. I have an USB drive attached to it. This is all being correctly recognized by Nova but the SRT file with subtitles is not being loaded, even if it has the same name of the video file. The subtitles are not recognized at all as they are not appearing pickable in the screen where you can start the playing.
If I try to open the same movie+SRT from a USB device everything is working fine and the subtitles are recognized and displayed.

### Steps to reproduce the issue

- Put the movie and SRT file in the same folder on a network multimedia server and try to enable subtitles

### Expected behavior

The SRT file should be recognized and enabled if requested, as it works when the files are on a USB device

Basically as the title says. I'm currently using mpv-android (set as standard external player in Nova) as it supports ass subtitles. However, after finishing an episode it switches back to Nova without marking the episode as watched.

### Steps to reproduce the issue

Hello,

I have recently set up a simple webDav server based on Apache on my local Archlinux NAS because SMB is giving me some speed issues with high bit rate videos.
Unfortunately I can't connect to the server using NOVA on my nVidia Shield.
In the connect dialog I choose ""webdav"" (there is no ssl involded), enter the local IP, port and path with a leading ""/"" (username and password are empty because not needed) and after confirming I get a message at the bottom of the screen saying ""You must specify a remote address"" and nothing else happens.
I have successfully connected to the server with Infuse running on an Apple TV and also with the X-Plore file manager on the Shield.

Could you please investigate? I'm quite certain I have entered all values correctly but maybe I missed something.

""I have a very specific error using Nova Video Player with just player as the one actually playing the files. This issue does not occur when I start SMB videos from the Just Video Player itself, but when starting them from NOVA player.

After 16-17min (every time) the video stops playing with the following error: ""java.net.ConnectException: Failed to connect to localhost/127.0.0.1:42057"".

This error occurs on the Samsung Tab A7 tablet.""

And got the following answer: 
""This looks really like Nova Video Player stops (or Android suspends the app) streaming/proxying video. I'm not sure what's the suspend policy when launching apps handling some intents but maybe it posting ongoing notification would help Nova. I'm afraid there's not much Just Player can do.""

The new multichannel PCM decoding implementation available in the recent 6.0.75 stable version doesn't work.

The feature should work when option 2 is selected in audio passthrough.

I tested a Dolby TrueHD video on an AndroidTV/GoogleTV device without Dolby TrueHD passthrough support and I though it was going to be decoded as multichannel PCM, instead, no audio was output and the video played fast.

Turning OFF passhtrough decodes the codec to PCM with no problem.

### Steps to reproduce the issue

1) Open Nova
2) Go to settings to make sure option 2 is selected in audio passthrough
2) Look for the video
3) Hit play

### Expected behavior

Audio codecs not supported for passthrough on a given device should be decoded as PCM or multichannel PCM.

Because of some problems with some other software, I had to revoke access to my Trake account to all apps. When I tried to sign in to Trakt with Nova Video Player on an Android TV device I came across two problems:

1. On the screen where I had to fill my username and password, the on-screen keyboard completely obscured the fields that I had to fill, I had to do it completely bindly.
2. After filling my user name and password, another windows poped up, presumably from Trakt, asking if I would allow access to my Trakt account, with a green Yes button and a red No button. My remote control only has directional and enter keys, I have tried almost every combination of button presses I could and I was not able to select any of the options, all I could do was go back and continue without Trakt integration.

It was not the first time I saw the keyboard obscure the fields, but it was the first time I could not complete the process.

### Steps to reproduce the issue

Try to sign in to Trakt on an Android TV 

### Expected behavior

Complete the process and link my Trakt account

I use the auto refresh rate option in Nova (as well as in Android settings menu), in order to properly play a movie at 60 fps (the others generally play at 24/25 fps).
It works nice in Kodi and Plex, and in Nova as well (if you just consider refresh rate).
Problem with Nova is, once back in Android Home Menu, my resolution and bit depth, previously at 4K / 60 hz / YCbCr420 change to 1080 / 60 hz / YCbCr444

Could you please have a look at it and fix it?

Thank you

### Steps to reproduce the issue

Use the auto refresh rate option in Nova, play a movie, and come back to Android's home.
Have a look to the settings, your resolution and your bit depth changed...

### Expected behavior

Resolution, bit depth and refresh rate should come back to their original settings once in Android Home Menu

It features a gorgeous interface that allows you to play your favourite music with ease.

All tracks are streamed directly at the highest quality from your Jellyfin library. Streaming not always an option? Any track in your Jellyfin library can be downloaded and played offline.",multimedia,https://github.com/leinelissen/jellyfin-audio-player/issues/282,[Bug] Wrong track selection when an album contains 2 discs (iOS),"### Description

When an album contains at least 2 parts (discs), if I select a song in the **second** disc, it triggers automatically the song of the **first** disc. 

Here is an example :

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50239d14-d42d-4c8d-839c-64b91b66b988)

On the above picture, if I select ""1 The Song Remains the same"", it will trigger and start ""1 Rock and Roll"" instead.

On Jellyfin from the web interface, **there is no such issue**.

PS : when the song ""7 The Ocean"" finishes, the behavior is normal and the next track is correctly triggered. The issue appears only when the song is selecting manually.

- iOS 18.4.1
- iPhone 16 Pro

Bonjour,

Les musiques commencent mais s'arrêtent avant la fin et le message d'erreur suivant s'affiche "" le média ne peut pas être lu ""
Même chose lorsque je fais une avance rapide sur les chansons 
Parfois le message d'erreur m'indique une erreur inconnue.
Ces problèmes interviennent après réinstallation de Rimusic. Avant la réinstallation le problème ne concernait pas toutes les musiques.
J'ai recherché des musiques au hasard qui n'étaient pas dans ma playlist, même problèmes.
Merci de m'aider.
Cordialement Laurent.

3. After searching for all the options, I came to report the problem. I saw all the solutions they had, I tried them all and none of them worked
4. In the end I downloaded the latest version again as a last option and it still shows an error during the download

### What more can you tell us? (Optional)

This happened in previous builds also, and would continue as each update happened. When it would happen I would revert to previous builds and/or previous save states. Which sometimes work and other times didn't. I would also just build the playlist by scratch but it would still continue. I use the Github version. I also saw a similar person with an open bug report but no fixes were given.

Whenever I use the Discord RPC thing it does not show the Album Cover neither the artist profile picture, also there is a bug that if you manually skip a song via the player, the RPC just shows the previous song until the entire song ends normally, than the next song comes as playing.

I'm using a vpn so the latency is huge. It certainly requires more time to load the song. I offen see it loads for a short time (about 5secs for 500 kb/s) but unable to download enough data to be played.
I think someone might have reported the issue before in #2852

On player, if you drag the bar out of it's height while it hasn't become a dot (if you hold it a bit then move it around), it stays in that position while not doing the seek action.

### What was your expectation?

Timeline seek action to work in all heights even when it's out of bounds.

1. Me dirijo a la biblioteca de descargas, en la llegada de esta versión obtuve problemas pues la ""E"" de contenido explicito no aparece en la reproducción.
2. La app se congela bastante inclusive si aumento la frecuencia de actualización a 120hz.
3. Sugiero que no agregen bastantes funciones ya que por ello la app se traba bastante u buscar soluciones para que no tenga tanto congelamiento.
4. El fondo degradado de la carátula dinámico (El que está en movimiento) hace que se trabe la cola de reproducción al deslizar, inclusive si se agregan o quitan funciones en el reproductor, es decir, mostrar mini cola, deslizamiento de texto de temas largos, mostrar tiempo de cola, etc.
5. La app consume batería no moderada del dispositivo.
6. Las descargas fallan.
7. La copia de seguridad falla.
8. Son detalles que no se solucionaran rápido pero me agradaría que estos errores disminuyan. ¡Gracias por este reproductor!

### What was your expectation?

For the songs to play normally.

### What more can you tell us? (Optional)

Ok so once I downloaded the new version, songs were playing just fine (shuffling an artist's discography) but after four songs or so it showed the media playing error. Restarted the app and it resumed playing just fine but the error happened again after a couple of songs. And now it's not playing at all. Yikes....

Having the same audio quality as before the mandatory YouTube Account 

### What more can you tell us? (Optional)

Since a YouTube Account is mandatory for listening to music, the audio quality is kinda weird, it feels like the audio is compressed. For musics that were downloaded before the update their quality is still nice but streamed musics and new downloaded musics have weird quality. My audio quality setting is at high.

Two options:

1. The app automatically ignores this thing and plays the song, no server error.
2. The app displays a pop-up with this warning, asking the user to confirm or deny. There will also be a setting which will allow the user to select whether they want to have this pop-up appear or always accept it.

OS : Ubuntu 24.04, 
Flatpak, 
Kodi  version 21.1, 
git 20240817-183eb85-dirty , 
with pvr iptv simple addon


Playing rtsp:// streams that come from the Fritzbox router ( dvb-c ) in a m3u file is very slow, stutters and hangs.
The following stream works fine with vlc:

example for a m3u :
#EXTINF:0 tvg-id=""DE_tagesschau24"" group-title=""VODAFONE"",Tagesschau24
#EXTVLCOPT:network-caching=1000
rtsp://192.168.178.1:554/?avm=1&freq=330&bw=8&msys=dvbc&mtype=256qam&sr=6900&specinv=1&pids=0,16,17,18,20,300,1301,1302,1303,1304,2171,2970,2976

## Expected Behavior
Here is a clear and concise description of what was expected to happen:
<!--- Tell us what should happen -->
<!--- Put your text below this line -->

Play rtsp:// Links from a m3u file without stutters. Changing Caching has effect.

## Actual Behavior
<!--- Tell us what happens instead -->
<!--- Put your text below this line -->

Changing Caching has no effect. Need Solution

## Possible Fix
<!--- Not obligatory, but suggest a fix or reason for the bug -->

Works when Hardware Accelaration is on for all vaapi things . But with poor Hardware with no vaapi build in it isnt possible.

### Describe the bug

Accessing a directory with a m3u file on a SMB share via Videos->name_of_the_smb_sources causes kodi to hang forever displaying a spinner

Bisecting through merge commits lead to PR #25798, kodi master githash 3732e39a5f9091a8fa1469e59394ebeafdb62743 is fine, githash fbb24cee85ea242a06a1246da106318a077ae53c and later show the issue

## Expected Behavior
Kodi shows the contents of the directory

## Actual Behavior
Kodi hangs and it's not possible to stop it (except via killing)

### To Reproduce

Create a m3u file in a directory that's shared via SMB, eg playlist/bbb.m3u with the following contents
```
https://download.blender.org/peach/bigbuckbunny_movies/big_buck_bunny_720p_h264.mov

Here is a clear and concise description of what the problem is:
After updating (Archlinux) to spdlog 1.14, and then downgrading to 1.13, I am unable to build. Going to an even earlier version fixes the issue, but requires downgrading fmt and doxygen as well.

A cleanup of the library also removes movies and series from sources that are available.
If a scan for new movies and series is made directly after the cleanup, the files and series that were previously deleted will be found again.

## Bug report

### Describe the bug

Here is a clear and concise description of what the problem is:

<!--- Provide a more detailed introduction to the issue itself, and why you consider it to be a bug -->
<!--- A bug report that is not clear will be closed -->
<!--- Put your text below this line -->

The subtitle precedence seems messed up if _Preferred subtitle language_ is set to `Original language`.

Additionally, _Prefer subtitles for the hearing impaired_ is completely ignored if _Preferred subtitle language_ is set to `Original language`.

## Expected Behavior

Here is a clear and concise description of what was expected to happen:

<!--- Tell us what should happen -->
<!--- Put your text below this line -->

If _Preferred subtitle language_ is set to `Original language` and a video has one or more subtitle tracks flagged as _original_, the precedence for those matching tracks should be exactly the same as if the tracks were matched by a specificied language, e.g matching English tracks if _Preferred subtitle language_ were set to `English`.

So, if _Preferred subtitle language_ is set to `Original language` and _Prefer subtitles for the hearing impaired_ is `disabled`, the precedence should be like this:

1. The first track with _original_ flag + any other flags
2. None (or maybe the _default_ track)

and if _Preferred subtitle language_ is set to `Original language` and _Prefer subtitles for the hearing impaired_ is `enabled`, the precedence should be like this:

1. The first track with _original_ and _hearing impaired_ flag + any other flags
2. The first track with _original_ flag + any other flags
3. None (or maybe the _default_ track)

## Actual Behavior

<!--- Tell us what happens instead -->
<!--- Put your text below this line -->

If _Preferred subtitle language_ is set to `Original language`, the precendence seems to be like this:

1. The first track with _original_ and _forced_ flag + any other flags
2. The first track with _default_ flag + any other flags, no matter the _original_ flag
3. The first track with _original_ flag + any other flags

Enabling _Prefer subtitles for the hearing impaired_ also has no effect.

## Possible Fix

<!--- Not obligatory, but suggest a fix or reason for the bug -->
<!--- Put your text below this line -->

On playback start, get all subtitle tracks with the _original_ flag, then apply the same precedence as if those tracks were matched by using a specifc language setting, e.g. _Preferred subtitle language_ = `English`.

BTW: currently, if _Preferred subtitle language_ is set to a specific language and _Prefer subtitles for the hearing impaired_ is `disabled`, the first track with the matching language is selected, purely based on the track order. But in my opinion no matter the setting of _Prefer subtitles for the hearing impaired_, _forced_ tracks matching the selected language should have the lowest precedence among the matching tracks, because if the user only wanted to play _forced_ tracks, they always have the option to set _Preferred subtitle language_ to `Forced only`. Of course this should also be true if _Preferred subtitle language_ is set to `Original language` and not to a specific language.

### To Reproduce

Steps to reproduce the behavior:

<!--- Provide a link to a live example, or an unambiguous set of steps to -->
<!--- reproduce this bug. Include code to reproduce, if relevant -->
<!--- Put your text below this line -->

1. Create a video file with multiple subtitle tracks
   1. Track with _original_ flag
   2. Track with _original_ and _hearing impaired_ flag
   3. Track with _original_ and _forced_ flag or alternatively a track with only the _default_ flag
2. Set _Preferred subtitle language_ to `Original language`
3. Play the video file
4. Observe track 3 getting selected even if the correct one should be track 1, or track 2 (if _Prefer subtitles for the hearing impaired_ is `enabled`)

### Debuglog

<!--- A debuglog is always mandatory when creating an issue. Provide one! -->

The debuglog can be found here:

### Screenshots

Here are some links or screenshots to help explain the problem:

The beginning of the video shows the correct behaviour if _Preferred subtitle language_ is set to `English`, and then the incorrect behavior seen on 3 files after setting _Preferred subtitle language_ to `Original language`.

All 3 files have their English tracks flagged as _original_ (Kodi sadly doesn't show the _original_ flag in the subtitle list):

- Batman has the most tracks
- Iron Man lacks the English _original_, _forced_ track compared to Batman
- Avengers lacks the Spanish _default_ track compared to Iron man

I created 3 files with different tracks to show the currently used precedence.

### Describe the bug
When I install Jellyfin video plugin to Kodi and sync my library, Movies are empty. Other libraries like TV Shows are properly synchornized. Looks like video plugin ""owns"" Movies (I can't add folders there) but movies are not pulled.
I found this problem on Android TV, but it also happens on PC and probably on other platforms, my logs are from PC.

This is a recent regression. I checked these revisions:
https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/commit/5198ea50825e1f5adbd55b467eb3982fa8618766 (master @ 2024-Jan-13) - bugged

## Expected Behavior
All libraries are synchonized.



## Actual Behavior
All libraries except for Movies are synchonized.



## Possible Fix
Compare two branches and check for suspicious commits?


### To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Install Kodi
2. Setup Jellyfin server, add library for Movies
3. Install Jellyfin plugin to Kodi, connect to the server, synchronize
4. See that Movies are still empty

Here is a clear and concise description of what the problem is:
<!--- Provide a more detailed introduction to the issue itself, and why you consider it to be a bug -->
<!--- A bug report that is not clear will be closed -->
<!--- Put your text below this line -->
When I close Kodi using the Kore app's button to send the Exit signal, kodi does close, but my desktop doesn't come back. With this I mean that the whole desktop stays black. I then have to OR cut the power OR run a script to get my desktop back:
```
kill `ps fx | grep lxsession | grep -v grep | sed -e 's/\?.*//' -e 's/\([^0-9]\)\+//'`
```

However if I close the Kodi using Kore (or any other controller) by going to the power menu of Kodi and then press the Exit button on the screen instead of on the Kore app, it will close Kodi and return my desktop.


## Expected Behavior
Here is a clear and concise description of what was expected to happen:
<!--- Tell us what should happen -->
<!--- Put your text below this line -->
I was expecting my Kodi to just close and return my desktop when I would send the close signal using the Kore app (and any other similar app)


## Actual Behavior
<!--- Tell us what happens instead -->
<!--- Put your text below this line -->
My Kodi closed and the screen stayed black.


## Possible Fix
<!--- Not obligatory, but suggest a fix or reason for the bug -->
<!--- Put your text below this line -->
I don't even know where I should look. For now I just use workarounds and I try to avoid using the feature as much as possible

<!--- A bug report that is not clear will be closed -->
<!--- Put your text below this line -->
Multiple Visualizations on my Windows 7 System don't seem to work at all. Apparently it's related to vertex shaders as all of the plugins show the same error in the log files (see below). I didn't test all of them, but here's a list.

Working:
- MilkDrop 2
- Spectrum
- Waveform

Not working:
- FishBMC
- PictureIt
- ProjectM (crashes Kodi)
- Shadertoy
- Starburst


## Expected Behavior
Here is a clear and concise description of what was expected to happen:
<!--- Tell us what should happen -->
<!--- Put your text below this line -->
All visualizations from the Kodi repo should be working and no error messages in the log files should appear.


## Actual Behavior
<!--- Tell us what happens instead -->
<!--- Put your text below this line -->
The visualizations only show a black screen (OSD is shown). The log file shows errors containing lines like these:
```

## Possible Fix
<!--- Not obligatory, but suggest a fix or reason for the bug -->
<!--- Put your text below this line -->
No idea. Might be a problem possibly fixed by updating to Windows 10.

Steps to reproduce the behavior:
<!--- Provide a link to a live example, or an unambiguous set of steps to -->
<!--- reproduce this bug. Include code to reproduce, if relevant -->
<!--- Put your text below this line -->
1. Run Kodi on a (my) Windows 7 (x64) system (Can't test any other device as none of them has Windows 7 anymore)
2. Play music with visualization from the non-working list (see at top)
3. See shader not working

Also tagging @graysky2 because this might be Arch Linux ARM specific. I'm 100% sure that I repeatedly build kodi successfully just last month. 

## Expected Behavior

Kodi builds without a problem. 


## Actual Behavior

The build process always error on something related to swig/the file `AddonModuleXbmcwsgi.i.cpp`

Since I upgraded to Fedora 38 (GNOME 44.0), Kodi's title bar is still visible when running n fullscreen mode.

## Expected Behavior
Here is a clear and concise description of what was expected to happen:
<!--- Tell us what should happen -->
<!--- Put your text below this line -->

When in fullscreen mode (selected under System→Display), I expect Kodi to take the complete screen space (which was the case while I was running Fedora 37).

## Actual Behavior
<!--- Tell us what happens instead -->
<!--- Put your text below this line -->

Kodi is not taking the complete screen space: the GNOME bar is still visible, along with Kodi's title bar (as if it was still windowed somehow)


### To Reproduce

Time ago i have implemented to InputStream interface AV1 support (PR #21390)
this can works correctly when we dont use our internal DRM decoder

but as you can see to relative implementation PR for InputStream Adaptive https://github.com/xbmc/inputstream.adaptive/pull/972
there still be present a problem when we use our DRM video decoder with the results having wrong images
![immagine](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3257156/221617343-c5ff43c0-ee36-41a8-83fd-c3d96d3966cc.png)

After investigating another time, i found that:
1) from addon inputstream interface is missing all video formats used by new generations codecs
https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/blob/master/xbmc/addons/kodi-dev-kit/include/kodi/c-api/addon-instance/video_codec.h#L48-L63
only YV12 / I420 is supported
2) from addon inputstream interface `GetFrameBuffer`:
https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/blob/master/xbmc/addons/kodi-dev-kit/include/kodi/addon-instance/VideoCodec.h#L367-L370
that make a callback to `CAddonVideoCodec::GetFrameBuffer`
https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/blob/master/xbmc/cores/VideoPlayer/DVDCodecs/Video/AddonVideoCodec.cpp#L351-L353
has hardcoded the video format to `AV_PIX_FMT_YUV420P` that make impossible for an binary addon playback correctly a stream that require a different video format

## Expected Behavior
Here is a clear and concise description of what was expected to happen:
<!--- Tell us what should happen -->
<!--- Put your text below this line -->
Having our DRM decoder working with all common video formats


## Actual Behavior
<!--- Tell us what happens instead -->
<!--- Put your text below this line -->
We cannot playback streams that use video formats differents from `AV_PIX_FMT_YUV420P`


## Possible Fix
<!--- Not obligatory, but suggest a fix or reason for the bug -->
<!--- Put your text below this line -->
1) add to input stream interface the minimal video formats required by Widevine DRM, you can see the full list here:
https://github.com/xbmc/inputstream.adaptive/blob/Omega/wvdecrypter/cdm/media/cdm/api/content_decryption_module.h#L273-L291
2) find a way to avoid `GetFrameBuffer` hardcode the video format, seems we cannot know the video format before call `GetFrameBuffer` from the DRM, the info is in the decoded picture, so we should have a way to set it when we call `CAddonVideoCodec::GetPicture` https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/blob/master/xbmc/cores/VideoPlayer/DVDCodecs/Video/AddonVideoCodec.cpp#L226-L272 since the property is already present in the `picture.videoFormat`


### To Reproduce

<!--- Put your text below this line -->
Unfurnately the only provider that i know have DRM AV1 is n€tflix
i dont know if there are DRM test streams AV1 or VP9 Profile 2 did not find any

1. install n€tflix addon
2. on addon expert settings enable AV1 and disable all other codecs
3. configure ISA to ask video quality, in order to make sure to play an AV1 stream
4. play a video recently added to the catalogue (the old movies/tvshow can not have AV1), at today ""Dune"" film is AV1 (but may change in future)

<!--- Put your text below this line -->
if i replace the video format hardcoded here
https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/blob/master/xbmc/cores/VideoPlayer/DVDCodecs/Video/AddonVideoCodec.cpp#L351-L353
with the correct format required for the DRM stream, so `AV_PIX_FMT_YUV420P10`
the image is rendered correctly on screen, as follow:

## Bug report
### Describe the bug
I go to a folder, local or DLNA (TwonkySeerver). Menu => Play. All files added to the playlist. Folder sorting is by title. When i go into the folder, sorting is correct. In the playlist, its different. Its not random, but not by title or by date.

I tried it with a fresh installation of Kodi 20. I compared it with a clean setup of Kodi 19.5, here it is correct. Although in my backup of 19.5 it works. After upgrade to 20 its wrong. So nothing else changed.

After upgrading from v19.x to v20, I could not play any of my media. Playing any media would give me the following message:
""Playback failed - One ore more items failed to play. Check the log for more information about this message.""
Then in the log, I would get the following kind of error:

## Expected Behavior
Here is a clear and concise description of what was expected to happen:
<!--- Tell us what should happen -->
<!--- Put your text below this line -->
My Kodi v19.x worked flawlessly, I expected Kodi v20 to work just the same after the upgrade.


## Actual Behavior
<!--- Tell us what happens instead -->
<!--- Put your text below this line -->
Kodi v20 does not work while Kodi v19.x worked with the same settings.


## Possible Fix
<!--- Not obligatory, but suggest a fix or reason for the bug -->
<!--- Put your text below this line -->
My system hosts file shows that my hostname (""nas"") is linked to 127.0.1.1. This is the default on Ubuntu:
cat /etc/hosts:
127.0.0.1 localhost
127.0.1.1 nas
[...]

Apparently, that does not play nice with Kodi v20. Again, that was not an issue with Kodi19. I worked around the issue by adding the following in my advancedsettings.xml:
```
  <pathsubstitution>
    <substitute>
      <from>smb://nas/</from>
      <to>smb://127.0.0.1/</to>
    </substitute>
  </pathsubstitution>
```
Note that adding <to>smb://127.0.1.1/</to> instead of <to>smb://127.0.0.1/</to> does not fix the issue and yields the same result as with no pathsubstitution at all.

## Bug report
### Describe the bug
Running Kodi 20 Nexus on a Sony Android TV, I wanted to change subtitles position, when I go to Settings-System-Display-Video Calibration and try to adjust any border using my remote control arrow keys - nothing happens. However when I tried using an external wireless keyboard I was able to adjust lines using my keyboard mousepad. So this is affecting only TV remote control.


## Expected Behavior
I should be able to adjust screen borders when in Video calibration mode using my TV remote control.


## Actual Behavior
Nothing happens, I just hear regular Kodi clicking sound when I am pressing the arrow keys on the remote control.


### To Reproduce
On Android TV, go to Settings-System-Display-Video Calibration and try to adjust any line using your TV remote control

Playback of HEVC/h265 on the Raspberry 2 and 3 is causing problems since the update from Kodi 18 to 19.4.
The problem only occurs with the Raspberry Pi 2 and 3. On the Raspberry Pi 4, HEVC playback works fine with the same videos.
Before the update with Kodi version 18, the same videos also ran without problems on Pi 2 and 3.

## Expected Behavior

Since playback on the Raspberry 2 and 3 worked fine with Kodi 18 I would expect this to work with Kodi 19.4 as well.

## Actual Behavior
<!--- Tell us what happens instead -->
<!--- Put your text below this line -->

The picture is jerky during playback and the picture and sound are not in sync.

## Possible Fix
<!--- Not obligatory, but suggest a fix or reason for the bug -->
<!--- Put your text below this line -->
Maybe there is a way to restore the behavior of the player from Kodi 18?

Maybe the kernel modules or the Raspberry firmware have changed with the newer Debian version (dtoverlay=vc4-kms-v3d?), so the Kodi player should be adapted as well or the new kernel/firmware has a bug or should be improved?

According to https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/issues/4112
setting of ""dtoverlay=vc4-fkms-v3d,cma-256"" in /boot/config.txt helped a bit but picture and sound are still not in sync.

Playing around with settings for the Kodi-Player was not successful. 

Trying to play the Video with a fresh xbian installation let Kodi crash.

With recent mesa git, its commit [egl: Remove eglextchromium.h and import eglext_angle.h](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/commit/f5bb9dd738ace274c97507adea073b6c609469b2) has done what it states and removed the eglextchromium.h header causing  Kodi to fail to compile xbmc/windowing/X11/GLContextEGL.cpp which used that header.

## Expected Behavior
_Here is a clear and concise description of what was expected to happen:_
<!--- Tell us what should happen -->

Compiles.


## Actual Behavior

## Possible Fix
<!--- Not obligatory, but suggest a fix or reason for the bug -->
<!--- Put your text below this line -->
Quick fix is to replace `#include <EGL/eglextchromium.h>` with `#include <EGL/eglext_angle.h>` in xbmc/windowing/X11/GLContextEGL.cpp but we need to be backwards compatible.

However adding a cmake test fails to ""find"" eglext_angle.h as the cmake compile test fails due to EGLAPIENTRYP being undefined. The eglext_angle.h is missing an include for eglplatform.h (which xbmc/windowing/X11/GLContextEGL.h does so via including EGL/eglext.h which is probably normal setup). Cannot see a way to get cmake to create a compile test that includes both headers. Trying check_include_files just tests each header individually. (And check_include_file also gives an annoying cmake CMP0075 warning.)

### Describe the bug
Here is a clear and concise description of what the problem is:

https://www.amazon.com/Control-Wireless-Sensing-Android-Projector/dp/B09JSX4JLB/

I have tried Keymap Editor Add-on to map the OK Button to the Action for it. For that button, I have not been able to get it to work in Kodi. The ""OK"" button works only if the mouse cursor is on. Once it's off and the remote's arrow buttons are used instead, the ""OK"" button no longer works.

## Expected Behavior
Here is a clear and concise description of what was expected to happen:

I expect the OK/Select Button to work. And if not, it should work after using Keymap Editor.

## Actual Behavior

No action is performed when pressing the Okay/Select Button. When using Keymap Editor, the button is detected, and a code is assigned for it as seen in the picture. However, Kodi still does not respond to that button.

## Possible Fix

### To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. I am using CoreElec Linux on a Samsung 65"" TV. Start CoreElec with the FIRC USB Dongle to the remote plugged in.
2. Move over different items in the menu with the Arrow Buttons on the remote. Try to select an item with the OK Button.
3. Nothing at all happens when using that button. The same applies to the Back Button. The Back Button only does not work when the mouse cursor is enabled in the remote. It works otherwise.

When Kodi v19.3 Settings->Player->Play Next Video Automatically->[Episodes|Movies] is enabled, ""Browse For Subtitle"" during video playback doesn't work as expected.

## Expected Behavior
Here is a clear and concise description of what was expected to happen:
<!--- Tell us what should happen -->
<!--- Put your text below this line -->

When Settings->Player->Play Next Video Automatically is enabled for episodes or movies, when a corresponding video is playing after having been launched from a file list, the user should be able to access Settings->Subtitle Settings->Browse For Subtitle and see a file browser where he can navigate to and select the subtitle (SRT) file appropriate to the playing video.

## Actual Behavior
<!--- Tell us what happens instead -->
<!--- Put your text below this line -->

When Settings->Player->Play Next Video Automatically is enabled for episodes or movies, when a corresponding episode or movie is playing after having been launched from a file list, accessing Settings->Subtitle Settings->Browse For Subtitle presents a list of episode|movie titles instead of a file browser. Selecting one of those video titles freezes Kodi 99% of the time and fails to present a subtitle 100% of the time.

This behavior doesn't occur when an episode|movie has been launched directly from the home screen via Recently Added Episodes (for episodes) or any movie poster that initiates direct playback (which is all of them, I think). But if a home screen click leads to a video browser (i.e. TV Shows/In Progress/Unwatched TV Shows), the bug will occur.

The ""Play Next Video Automatically"" switches for episodes and movies will cause this behavior for whichever entity (episode|movie) is enabled. For instance, if only episodes are set to play automatically, the bug will be present for episodes but not for movies.

The consequences of enabling Play Next Video for other entities (Music Videos, TV Shows, Uncategorized) has not been tested.

## Possible Fix
<!--- Not obligatory, but suggest a fix or reason for the bug -->
<!--- Put your text below this line -->

Kodi 17 & 18 had a related bug. If Play Next Video Automatically was enabled, a downloaded subtitle would not be saved next to the video. Whatever mechanism was responsible for moving the SRT from the temp dir to the video dir would apparently not occur successfully. That bug is not present in v19, but the bug in this problem report may be related.

### To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
<!--- Provide a link to a live example, or an unambiguous set of steps to -->
<!--- reproduce this bug. Include code to reproduce, if relevant -->
<!--- Put your text below this line -->
1. Enable Settings->Player->Play Next Video Automatically for ""Episodes"" 
2. Navigate to a TV show from Home->TV Shows->[series title]->[season] and begin playback of an episode
3. During playback, access the Settings menu via the OSD and select Subtitle Settings->Browse For Subtitle
4. Instead of a file browser, you should see a list of video titles (episodes or movies, whichever is appropriate to the video in play.)
5. Clicking any video title in the list will cause Kodi to freeze and require it to be forcibly killed via Task Manager 
or pkill, etc.

Kodi is not able to play UPnP streams from Panasonic devices (TV and BluRay/DVB-t video recorder).

I have a new Panasonic TV that can record DVB-T programs and then streams them by UPnP.
Kodi correctly discovers the UPnP TV but failed to play any stream from it.

Same behaviour on a Panasonic BluRay/DVB-t video recorder.
Same behaviour on different Kodi versions (Leia and Matrix) on different OS (Linux / macOS / Android / Raspbian).

VLC correctly plays these UPnP streams on all the combination devices / OS I can try.

Apparently it is an old bug and a regression from older Kodi version:

Hello, I have a video that has problems with the audio, after a few seconds the ""aq"" starts dropping and it buffers (vq is fine).
The source speed cannot be the problem because full 4K blu-rays with TrueHD and Atmos play fine, however, with this video, even when playing from the local disk it buffers.
This is weird because it's the only video that has problems both in the Shield TV Pro 2019 and Windows 10. Other files with similar audio encodings work fine.
I believe it is a kodi issue (or maybe ffmpeg?) because when I play it with MPV it works fine (WebDav and local disk)

Thanks in advance for your time
## Expected Behavior
<!--- Tell us what should happen -->
<!--- Put your text below this line -->
Play the file without issues.


## Actual Behavior
<!--- Tell us what happens instead -->
<!--- Put your text below this line -->
Buffering and sometimes kodi tries to correct it by seeking a few seconds back with no success until it skips a bit forward and plays fine for 1 or 2 minutes (I think the drops occur in specific timestamps but the file mustn't be corrupted since MPV manages to play it no problem)

I'm trying to setup Youtube addon and it requires an API key and related credentials to be inserted.

## Actual Behavior
<!--- Tell us what happens instead -->
<!--- Put your text below this line -->
Text pasting doesn't work at all or at least in a conventional way

## Possible Fix
<!--- Not obligatory, but suggest a fix or reason for the bug -->

In JSON-RPC API, the [`Player.OnPropertyChanged`](https://kodi.wiki/view/JSON-RPC_API/v10#Player.OnPropertyChanged) notification isn't sent when `shuffle` (or `repeat`) properties changed and player is inactive.

Distortion of subtitles when playing a 3D video on Raspberry Pi. Some subtitles display okay, but others are displayed horizontally stretched, so up to half of the text is off the screen. I *think* it affects image-based subtitle formats (e.g. PGS) but not text-based (e.g. SRT) - but I'm not certain of that. It's quite easy to reproduce. I've seen this under both OSMC and LibreELEC.

## Bug report
### Describe the bug

In v18, when ""Adjust Display Refresh Rate"" is selected, audio passthrough does not initially start working and the audio output is PCM. While the movie is playing, the movie can be paused and bringing up the audio menu and see that Audio Passthrough is enabled. While in the movie, disabling passthrough and then re-enabling causes passthrough to work correctly. This worked correctly in Krypton.

If ""Adjust Display Refresh Rate"" is disabled then bitstreaming starts immediately on playback.

This might be related to using Intel UHD 630 as there are [several reports of users](https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=340358) using this same onboard graphics chipset.

## Expected Behavior

Passthrough should start immediately on playing the video, whether Adjust Display Refresh Rate is enabled or not.

<!--- Provide a link to a live example, or an unambiguous set of steps to -->
<!--- reproduce this bug. Include code to reproduce, if relevant -->
<!--- Put your text below this line -->
1. Set ""Allow Passthrough"" in the Audio Settings Menu
2. Start playback of a movie with a supported audio format (such as AC-3).
3. See that the output is PCM.
4. Bring up Audio menu of video.
5. Disable Audio Passthrough option.
6. Re-enable Audio Passthrough.
-> Video is now bitstreaming properly.

I'm currently running Kodi Leia RC1 on a Shield TV (Oreo).  I have the Shield connected to a Onkyo TX-NR646 receiver.  If I turn the receiver off or on Kodi will stop. 
This started happening after I did a receiver firmware update.  I contacted Onkyo and they said it's not their problem (nor can I roll back the firmware). 
I also updated Kodi from Beta 4 to Beta 5 around the same time.  I know Kodi didn't have this problem on Beta 4 but I don't know for sure if it was working OK on Beta 5.  I noticed the problem right after I updated the receiver firmware.  

The problem goes away if I move the Shield HDMI cable from a HDCP 2.2 port on the receiver to a HDCP 1.4 port .  
The problem goes away if I disable HDMI pass-through on the receiver.  

I previously had a similar problem when I turned my TV off (thread here: https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=334484).  
I worked with a moderator on the Nvidia Shield TV forum for a work-around.  They created a special Shield OS image for me that didn't stop Kodi (I was using version 17.6 for the troubleshooting).  He said this time that this is a Kodi problem with Kodi 18 and Oreo:

""In the bug report it looks also like you're using a new version of Kodi now.

Our work around avoided relaunching the app as the app was coded for androird apps pre android O. with the new app which is written from o, the workaround doesn't kick in because the android O apps should be able to handle the ability to relaunch the app.

When the receiver goes off, kodi sees a display change and currently it's not handle the changing and asking the app to relaunch and then it fails to relaunch. Kodi needs to either have the app handle the mode change without relaunching it or fix the app so when it relaunches it doesn't crash.""

I also did some testing with the Shield connected to the HDCP 2.2 port, HDMI pass-through enabled, Shield resolution set to 4K, Kodi GUI set to 3840x2160p, and 3840x2160p being the only white listed resolution in Kodi. I turned the TV off and on and the receiver off and on separately: 
Turning the TV on with the Shield colorspace set at Rec. 2020 (both 10 bit and 12 bit) causes Kodi to stop. 
Turning the receiver on with the Shield colorspace set at Rec. 709 (both 10 bit and 12 bit) causes Kodi to stop. 
Changing the Kodi GUI resolution or turning the HDMI pass-through off will alter what actions cause Kodi to stop. 
I could not find a combination of settings that that would not stop Kodi under all off/on circumstances when connected to a HDCP 2.2 port. 
Nor could I find a combination of settings that would cause Kodi to stop when connected to a HDCP 1.4 port.

**Describe the bug**
First of all I wanna say that it is not the typical issue with the thumbnails, as it is configured as suggested and clipious doesn't throw an error when adding my server.

When I access clipious some videos show their thumbnail and some of them show an image with an exclamation. 
![ResizedImage_2024-11-11_16-46-39_2343.jpg](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/908c7572-cd90-4150-aa1f-baf4fc01c5de)

Those that show the exclamation keep trying to load but never play and cannot be downloaded (they keep trying but never download).

I have tried to watch them directly on invidious and there is no problem with those videos using the Invidious instance.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to the app
2. Scroll down and find a video with an exclamation per thumbnail.
3. See error

**Expected behavior**
The thumbnail shows, the video plays and can be downloaded.

I connected a new server (invidious.private.coffee) to Clipious. On this server I already have an account with subscriptions. In the web browser, everything is working fine.

Now, when I use Clipious, the subscriptions won't show at all. I can manually add elements to the subscription section by subscribing to a channel, but subscriptions on Clipious deviate from my instance subscriptions.

Even more so, when I connect to a different instance, Clipious will still show the manually subscribed channel videos of the first instance and never the ones I subscribed to in the web browser view

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. In the browser register to https://invidious.private.coffee and subscribe to some channels. Check that the SUBSCRIPTIONS section of the instance shows every video of the subscriptions
2. Connect this server to Clipious, login to it with the same account and then check subscriptions ... nothing is showing
3. Manually subscribe to a channel
4. Check Clipious subscriptions, the channel should show
5. Switch server on Clipious. Check subscriptions. The same subscriptions show as on other server instance

**Expected behavior**
Clipious should show the subscriptions of the instance and not maintain a separate subscription list

I added an additional invidious instance to clipious and logged in to this instance. On the web ui of the instance I can clearly see my subscribed videos and my viewing history. But in Clipious those views are always empty (also after waiting for a few hours).

I tested the endpoint via

### Current Behavior

Hello. I tried searching for this bug and found similar issues but they didn't seem exactly the same? But I'm really sorry if this is a repeat, this website doesn't work the best on mobile so idk sorry.

Anyway, I tried to play the song El Mañana Live at the Manchester Opera House by Gorillaz and it played O Green World Live instead all while saying it was playing El Mañana. I've had it do this with a few other songs too. There's no alternative either so can I just not listen to the song I want to? Is there a way to fix the mismatch? 

### Expected Behavior

It should play the correct song when the title is selected. 

### Steps to reproduce

1. Opened App
2. Searched ""El Manana Live""
3. Clicked ""El Mañana - Live at Manchester Opera House"" with Matching Album Cover
4. It Played ""O Green World"" Live Audio Instead

### Current Behavior

It might not be a bug but more of an annoyance with the app.

If I've set the battery saver settings for the app on anything other than No Restrictions (MIUI) it keeps bringing up the settings to change it and it kinda annoys me, it should be just a fresh install kinda thing and after that it should stop pestering the user.

### Expected Behavior

It only brings up the battery saver settings for Spotube only the first time after install and never again.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Install Spotube.
2. Set the battery saver settings for it on anything but No Restrictions.
3. Start the app however many times you want.

- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### Current Behavior

Operating System: Pop!_OS (Linux)
My Current Spotube Version: v3.4.1 (Latest Release)

Encountering persistent playback interruptions at specific timestamps during the playback of a particular music track. To temporarily resolve the issue, I have observed that forwarding the music by 2 or 3 seconds allows it to resume normal playback. Notably, the problem consistently occurs at the same timeline when replaying the music. Seeking assistance to identify and address this playback disruption in the GitHub repository.

Affected Songs for Reference:
- ""Reminder"" by **The Weeknd**: Experiencing interruptions at the 20th second.
- ""Starboy"" by **The Weeknd**: Experiencing interruptions at the 15th second.

### Expected Behavior

The music should play seamlessly without any interruptions or disruptions at any point in the track. Users should be able to enjoy a smooth and uninterrupted listening experience throughout the entire duration of the song.

### Steps to reproduce

Bug Scenario Steps:

1. Open the Application.
2. Search for ""StarBoy"" by ""The Weeknd.""
3. Click on the first song.
4. Allow the application to play the song.
5. Observe that the playback automatically stops at the 15th second, despite the expectation of continuous playback.

The issue still seems unresolved.

While playing a song, then exiting the app, the song stops playing. When the app is reopened, the mini player disappears (it can, for some reason, be brought back by pressing the 'back' button in Android's navigation menu).
After this, when I attempt to play another song, the app crashes.

### Describe the bug
When Kodi is started using the [cage](https://github.com/cage-kiosk/cage) window manager and there is no display attached, then Kodi crashes (and cage exits).
I describe the same problem on an issue on cage https://github.com/cage-kiosk/cage/issues/279

Additional context:
I tried to work around this by explicitly adding a headless output to cage, which works, but currently can't be removed at runtime again. Once the HDMI display is available, Kodi then spans both outputs, which means I won't see all of it on the HDMI display.
I tried to find out how to only start Kodi once the HDMI display is attached, but this seems to be the one thing that is dam need impossible on Linux, if you are not already running a display manager.

## Expected Behavior
My preferred behavior would be that Kodi is able to handle this case and delay initializing the GUI until an display is available. If that is not something that the Kodi team wants to implement, then it I would at least expect Kodi to exit cleanly with an error message.

## Actual Behavior
It simply crashes with an segmentation fault.


## Possible Fix
* Delay initializing the GUI until a display is available
* Exit with an error message

### To Reproduce
1. Install cage and kodi
2. Disconnect all screens and connect to the machine via SSH
3. Start Kodi using cage, for example `/usr/bin/cage -- /usr/bin/kodi-standalone`


### Debuglog
Unfortunately, the crashlog written by Kodi doesn't contain any error messages, even the stack trace part is empty.

However, a stack trace logged by systemd-coredump is available: https://paste.kodi.tv/ohihupideg

## Bug report
### Describe the bug
Here is a clear and concise description of what the problem is:
Kodi crashes after attempting to start movie with [Netflix plugin](https://github.com/CastagnaIT/plugin.video.netflix) from the beginning at the highest 4k Dolby Vision quality (in this case I tried to play ""Glass Onion"", but I also had this issue with ""Ocean's Twelve"" and ""Ocean's Thirteen"").
<!--- Provide a more detailed introduction to the issue itself, and why you consider it to be a bug -->
<!--- A bug report that is not clear will be closed -->
<!--- Put your text below this line -->
I have InputStream Adaptive set to ""manual OSD"", after I start a movie, it opens successfully in highest 1080p quality. But when I change the quality to highest 4k stream (~18.4Mbps, Dolby Vision), then stop playing and start it again from the beginning, Kodi remembers the last chosen video track, attempts to play it, gets stuck on loading and crashes on stop button. Log has these 2 errors repeating:
error <general>: CDVDVideoCodecAndroidMediaCodec:GetOutputPicture dequeueOutputBuffer failed
error <general>: CDVDVideoCodecAndroidMediaCodec::GetPicture dequeueInputBuffer failed
Kodi does not crash if I try to start movie not from the beginning (e.g. continue watching at 0:00:23), or if the quality is set to a different video track (tried second to highest (4k ~9.2Mbps, Dolby Vision)). And if I start to play movie successfully, chose the best quality and rewind to the beginning, movie plays correctly (I did that with logging: https://paste.kodi.tv/akejoveyif.kodi). Issue is also present if InputStream Adaptive is set to ""Ask quality"", movie is started from the beginning, and I chose the best 4k stream.

### Describe the bug
I installed Kodi 20 on my Windows 10 PC when it was released & everything seemed to be working OK. However I noticed that when trying to access a folder, Browse a Youtube channel or some other addon page that included a file with odd characters in the filename (Which usually displayed as square boxes on Kodi 19) it immediately causes Kodi to freeze.

I was using the xonfluence skin initially but experienced the same thing on several other skins which I have tried although at times more severe as it would freeze with just Japanese or Korean characters in filenames/video titles.

The issue isn't present when using Estuary with the default font however Kanji & other asian text is displayed as boxes & upon changing the font to 'Arial Based' Estuary then also starts causing freezes when trying to access folders/addon pages that feature non western characters in filenames/video titles.


## Expected Behavior
It should load the file lists without issue, Usually displaying non supported characters with boxes or not at all.

## Actual Behavior
It crashes.

### To Reproduce
The title of this Youtube video is one that causes it.

> Was shown error box ""Dynamic fee estimates not available"" when trying to use the ""Max"" button to send all of a UTXO value. Due to the error I instead manually set the value to send, estimating the fee value wondering if I could specify in more detail later. Then in the ""Create transaction"" window I set a target fee value in the text box and got this crash.

I opened Terminal emulator, then typed in `shfm`. I didn't fully understand how it works and pressed Ctrl+C, hoping I can get back to emulator and type `?`, as suggested.

Instead, the whole thing exited and I was greeted by Kindle Home screen. 
Then I went to KUAL - KOReader again, and KUAL was quite slow, it took about 3 seconds after I hit buttons.

* Device: Linux

#### Issue

Hi, I'm trying to set up my dev environment, but the emulator quits immediately after starting. Any idea what could cause this? I tried using older images, but the same still occurs. Any help will be much appreciated. 

#### Steps to reproduce

```
git clone https://github.com/koreader/koreader.git
git checkout tags/v2023.03 -b releases/v2023.03
docker run -v $(pwd)/koreader:/home/ko/koreader -it koreader/koappimage:latest bash
cd koreader && ./kodev fetch-thirdparty
```

```
docker run -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -v $(pwd)/koreader:/home/ko/koreader -it koreader/koappimage:latest bash -c ""source ~/.bashrc && pushd koreader && ./kodev run --no-build -s=kobo-aura-one""
```

The emulator flashes and quits immediately with a segfault. 

Please see this terminal output:
[crash.log](https://github.com/koreader/koreader/files/11041345/crash.log)


##### `crash.log` (if applicable)
`crash.log` is a file that is automatically created when KOReader crashes. It can normally be found in the KOReader directory:

* `/mnt/private/koreader` for Cervantes
* `koreader/` directory for Kindle
* `.adds/koreader/` directory for Kobo
* `applications/koreader/` directory for Pocketbook

Android logs are kept in memory. Please go to [Menu] → Help → Bug Report to save these logs to a file.

Please try to include the relevant sections in your issue description.
You can upload the whole `crash.log` file (zipped if necessary) on GitHub by dragging and dropping it onto this textbox.

If your issue doesn't directly concern a Lua crash, we'll quite likely need you to reproduce the issue with *verbose* debug logging enabled before providing the logs to us.
To do so, from the file manager, go to [Tools] → More tools → Developer options, and tick both `Enable debug logging` and `Enable verbose debug logging`.
You'll need to restart KOReader after toggling these on.

If you instead opt to inline it, please do so behind a spoiler tag:

#### Issue

When tapping on `One-finger swipe` within the `Gesture manager` menu, KOReader crashes.

2. Tap on `Taps and gestures`
3. Tap on `Gesture manager`

I entered the `One-finger swipe` menu successfully a couple of days before where I configured a ""bottom left"" swipe to trigger a `Reader > Set highlight action > Highlight` action.

Additionally, Saber is available across all your devices, large and small, and syncs between them seamlessly.Notably, it can invert your notes when you're in dark mode. This allows you to write with white ink on a black background, which is much easier on the eyes in low-light environments like when the teacher turns off the lights in class.Images and PDFs are also inverted, so you can still use a digital printout or a textbook without the fuss.Saber uses a dual-password system to protect your notes from anyone but you, even if they have complete control over the server. You can safely store your notes on the official Saber server, another server, or even host your own!The app is completely open-source so that anyone can view the source code and see exactly what it's doing and how it handles your data. Many other note-taking apps are closed-source and proprietary, meaning that their inner workings are a mystery to the public.As someone who studies maths, highlighting multi-line equations was always a hassle with other apps, where the highlighter would change color when it overlapped with itself. Another problem I had was that in some apps, the highlighter would render on top of the text, fading it out and making it hard to read.Saber's highlighter has no such issues. It utilizes canvas compositing to render the highlighter in a way that is consistent with/better than traditional paper, where it handles overlaps and maintains color consistency.Saber has everything you need to keep your notes organized. Create folders inside folders inside folders to your heart's content with no limit on the number of nested folders. And even though a note may be buried deep within a nested folder, you can still access it easily with your most recent notes always available on the home screen.Discover a whole new way to capture and organize your thoughts with Saber.

### Describe the bug

When a backup completes and the app should now be hidden from the list, the app crashes instead.

### To Reproduce

1. List options > Without backups
2. Long-press an app > More options > Backup/Restore
3. Take a backup
   * App Manager crashes when it completes
   * ""Backing up <app>..."" notification lingers, but files appear to be all present
   * Crash report generated

### Expected behavior

Backups to complete successfully, and the list view to update and hide the now-backed-up app.

I started using the app yesterday, and I'm loving it so far! However, I've encountered some bugs:

When both Focus Mode and App Blocker are enabled simultaneously, opening an app results in significant (and often random) bugs and occasional crashes. Since Focus Mode and App Blocker overlap in functionality, it might help to automatically disable the App Blocker for apps already managed by Focus Mode (during focus sessions) to avoid conflicts.

Additionally, it would be very helpful to have a built-in Focus Mode timer within the app interface itself. Currently, if the notification is dismissed, there's no way to track how much time is left.

Thank you for your great work!

### Description

I originally thought file creation was completely broken, but then realized I'd unintentionally switched to the ""None"" file type and that was what was causing the app to crash.

Sorry, I have not tried the latest dev version. It's not affecting me now that I know I just had to switch the type, but it still seems wrong that a supported feature would crash the app.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Click the ""+ in lower right corner while on ""Files"" tab
2. Type in a file name e.g. ""abc""
3. Select ""None"" file type
4. Click ""OK""
5. App crashes

### Description

I have just downloaded Markor on my Android Samsun A22 mobile phone. I also have Dropbox. I want to view my Dropbox files using Markor.
I also use Stackedit (https://stackedit.io/app#) on my pc.  I decided to export Stackedit's Welcome file as .md to my Dropbox folder and try to view it on my mobile. I can select the ""Welcome file.md"" file in Dropbox, and I am offered a chance to view it with The Dropbox editor, or Markor. If I choose the Dropbox Text Editor, it works fine, but if I choose Markor it just crashes back to my home page. Just out of interest, I renamed it to a .txt file and Markor was able to display it OK, albeit not in markdown format.


### Steps to reproduce

1. Export Stackedit Welcome file as markdown to Dropbox folder
2. Open Stackedit Welcome file.md in Dropbox
3. Select Markor to view it

### Description

Sometimes when I launch Markor (or mordor) and the view it goes to isn't the default, like the todo list for example, when I go back to the folder view and hit the Plus sign the app crashes with this error:

`FATAL EXCEPTION: main
Process: net.gsantner.markor, PID: 28028

`

### Steps to reproduce

1.  Launch the app, go edit a note, and stay on that screen.
2. Switch apps, do other stuff for a long time
3. Relaunch the app, exit whatever view you're in and go to the Files view and hit Plus
4. App crashes 

This is honestly a royal pain to reproduce, it's rare enough that I had to switch to using Mordor for a few days in order to see if it had the same bug.
