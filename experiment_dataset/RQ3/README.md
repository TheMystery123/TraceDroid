# README


This document details the experimental data for **Research Question 3 (RQ3)** in the paper TraceDroid. RQ3 evaluates TraceDroid’s practical utility in real-world scenarios by testing popular Google Play apps, detecting unknown crash bugs, and validating results with developers.


## 1. Introduction  

RQ3 extends beyond controlled open-source datasets to validate TraceDroid’s real-world value. We tested TraceDroid alongside 5 top-performing baselines (selected from RQ1’s results) on popular Android apps from Google Play. The focus was on: 

- Identifying **previously unreported crash bugs** (not documented in public issue trackers).  
- Verifying bug validity through direct **developer feedback** (fixes or confirmations).  


## 2. Dataset Selection Criteria

To ensure reproducibility and representativeness, apps were selected using strict filters:  

| Criterion | Description |  
|-----------|-------------|  
| Initial Pool | 200 randomly selected popular apps from Google Play, spanning categories (e.g., Productivity, Fitness, Finance) to ensure functional diversity. |  
| Filter 1: Decompilability | Apps must be decompiled to retrieve source code (required for TraceDroid’s heuristic-based suspicious code detection). |  
| Filter 2: UI Accessibility | UIAutomator (Android testing tool) must extract both **view hierarchies** (for widget identification) and **GUI screenshots** (for runtime validation). |  
| Final Dataset | 116 apps remained post-filtering, with download volumes ranging from 500K+ to 5M+. |  


## 3. Full RQ3 Experimental Data Table

Below is the complete dataset of detected bugs (reproduced from Table 3 in the source document), including app details, bug status, and baseline detection results.

## 4. Data Fields Explanation

Each column in the table is defined below for clarity:  

| Field       | Description                                                                 |  
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| `ID`        | Unique identifier for each detected bug (1–21).                             |  
| `App Name`  | Name of the Google Play app where the bug was found.                        |  
| `Download`  | App’s estimated download volume (indicates popularity).                     |  
| `Category`  | App’s functional category (per Google Play’s classification).               |  
| `Version`   | Exact app version tested (critical for reproducing bugs).                   |  
| `Status`    | Bug validation status (see Section 5 for definitions).                     |  
| `TimeM`     | Whether Time-Machine (random/rule-based baseline) detected the bug.         |  
| `Comb`      | Whether ComboDroid (model-based baseline) detected the bug.                 |  
| `Huma`      | Whether Humanoid (learning-based baseline) detected the bug.                |  
| `Guard`     | Whether Guardian (LLM-based baseline) detected the bug.                     |  
| `BugH`      | Whether BugHunter (bug-driven baseline) detected the bug.                   |  


## 5. Bug Status Definitions

Bugs were classified based on direct feedback from app developers:  

| Status     | Definition                                                                 |  
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| `Fixed`    | Developer confirmed the bug and released an update to resolve it (15/21 bugs). |  
| `Confirmed`| Developer acknowledged the bug as valid but had not fixed it at submission (6/21 bugs). |  
| `Status`   | No developer feedback recorded for this entry (ID 1 only).                  |  


## 6. Key Experimental Results

From the dataset, the following key findings validate TraceDroid’s utility:  
- **Total Unknown Bugs**: TraceDroid detected 21 previously unreported crash bugs across 116 apps.  
- **Developer Validation**: 100% of detected bugs were validated (15 fixed, 6 confirmed).  
- **Baseline Comparison**: The top-performing baseline (BugHunter) detected only 6 of these 21 bugs—all were a subset of TraceDroid’s detections. No other baseline found additional bugs.  


## 7. Access to Supplementary Materials

All RQ3 supplementary materials are publicly available in the TraceDroid repository, including:  
- **Bug Reproduction Guides**: Step-by-step instructions to replicate each detected bug.  
- **Developer Feedback Screenshots**: Emails/messages from developers confirming/fixing bugs.  
- **Test Logs**: Raw execution logs for TraceDroid and baselines (with bug detection timestamps).
